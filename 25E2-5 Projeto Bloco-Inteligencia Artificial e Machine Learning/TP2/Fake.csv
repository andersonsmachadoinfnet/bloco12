 Sheriff David Clarke Becomes An Internet Joke For Threatening To Poke People ‘In The Eye’,"On Friday, it was revealed that former Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke, who was being considered for Homeland Security Secretary in Donald Trump s administration, has an email scandal of his own.In January, there was a brief run-in on a plane between Clarke and fellow passenger Dan Black, who he later had detained by the police for no reason whatsoever, except that maybe his feelings were hurt. Clarke messaged the police to stop Black after he deplaned, and now, a search warrant has been executed by the FBI to see the exchanges.Clarke is calling it fake news even though copies of the search warrant are on the Internet.

 Racist Alabama Cops Brutalize Black Boy While He Is In Handcuffs (GRAPHIC IMAGES),"The number of cases of cops brutalizing and killing people of color seems to see no end. Now, we have another case that needs to be shared far and wide. An Alabama woman by the name of Angela Williams shared a graphic photo of her son, lying in a hospital bed with a beaten and fractured face, on Facebook. It needs to be shared far and wide, because this is unacceptable.It is unclear why Williams  son was in police custody or what sort of altercation resulted in his arrest, but when you see the photo you will realize that these details matter not. Cops are not supposed to beat and brutalize those in their custody. In the post you are about to see, Ms. Williams expresses her hope that the cops had their body cameras on while they were beating her son, but I think we all know that there will be some kind of convenient  malfunction  to explain away the lack of existence of dash or body camera footage of what was clearly a brutal beating. Hell, it could even be described as attempted murder. Something tells me that this young man will never be the same. Without further ado, here is what Troy, Alabama s finest decided was appropriate treatment of Angela Williams  son:No matter what the perceived crime of this young man might be, this is completely unacceptable. The cops who did this need to rot in jail for a long, long time   but what you wanna bet they get a paid vacation while the force  investigates  itself, only to have the officers returned to duty posthaste?This, folks, is why we say BLACK LIVES MATTER. No way in hell would this have happened if Angela Williams  son had been white.

" Trump Said Some INSANELY Racist Stuff Inside The Oval Office, And Witnesses Back It Up","In the wake of yet another court decision that derailed Donald Trump s plan to bar Muslims from entering the United States, the New York Times published a report on Saturday morning detailing the president s frustration at not getting his way   and how far back that frustration goes.According to the article, back in June, Trump stomped into the Oval Office, furious about the state of the travel ban, which he thought would be implemented and fully in place by then. Instead, he fumed, visas had already been issued to immigrants at such a rate that his  friends were calling to say he looked like a fool  after making his broad pronouncements.It was then that Trump began reading from a document that a top advisor, noted white supremacist Stephen Miller, had handed him just before the meeting with his Cabinet. The page listed how many visas had been issued this year, and included 2,500 from Afghanistan (a country not on the travel ban), 15,000 from Haiti (also not included), and 40,000 from Nigeria (sensing a pattern yet?), and Trump expressed his dismay at each.According to witnesses in the room who spoke to the Times on condition of anonymity, and who were interviewed along with three dozen others for the article, Trump called out each country for its faults as he read: Afghanistan was a  terrorist haven,  the people of Nigeria would  never go back to their huts once they saw the glory of America, and immigrants from Haiti  all have AIDS. Despite the extensive research done by the newspaper, the White House of course denies that any such language was used.But given Trump s racist history and his advisor Stephen Miller s blatant white nationalism, it would be no surprise if a Freedom of Information Act request turned up that the document in question had the statements printed inline as commentary for the president to punctuate his anger with. It was Miller, after all, who was responsible for the  American Carnage  speech that Trump delivered at his inauguration.This racist is a menace to America, and he doesn t represent anything that this country stands for. Let s hope that more indictments from Robert Mueller are on their way as we speak.Featured image via Chris Kleponis/Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 23, 2017"
" Papa John’s Founder Retires, Figures Out Racism Is Bad For Business","A centerpiece of Donald Trump s campaign, and now his presidency, has been his white supremacist ways. That is why so many of the public feuds he gets into involve people of color. One of his favorite targets, is, of course, the players in the National Football League who dare to exercise their First Amendment rights by kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racist police brutality. Well, there is one person who has figured out that racism is bad for business, even if it did get the orange overlord elected: The founder of the pizza chain Papa John s.This is a man who has never been on the right side of history on any number of issues, and plus his pizza sucks. But, when he decided to complain about the players protesting, his sales really dropped. Turns out racism doesn t pay, and we all know that corporations are all about the bottom line. Therefore, Papa John Schnatter will no longer be CEO of the hack pizza chain.BREAKING: Papa John's founder John Schnatter to step down as CEO; announcement comes weeks after he criticized NFL over protests.  AP Business News (@APBusiness) December 21, 2017The thing is, while people are certainly allowed to have political opinions, they have to realize that those opinions can often come with dire consequences   especially if one is in the business of trying to garner sales and support from any and all people, which one would presume is the goal of all CEO s. No one knows whether or not the pressure from his shareholders, the public outcry or boycotts, or even the NFL itself had anything to do with his stepping down. As of right now, all we know is that he will be gone, and perhaps the future CEO will run a company that is inclusive of the diverse fabric that we call America. After all, the guiding symbol of this nation will always be the Statue of Liberty, and bigots like Trump and Schnatter are the past. The rest of us are the future. We just have to survive the present to get there.Featured image via Rob Kim/Getty Images",News,"December 21, 2017"
 WATCH: Paul Ryan Just Told Us He Doesn’t Care About Struggling Families Living In Blue States,"Republicans are working overtime trying to sell their scam of a tax bill to the public as something that directly targets middle-class and working-class families with financial relief. Nothing could be further from the truth, and they re getting hammered on that repeatedly. Speaking on CNBC, Paul Ryan was going full throttle, trying to convince us that the paltry savings we re getting is actually wait for it big money.But he didn t just go with the usual talking points. With a smug look that only someone who grew up in a wealthy family can muster when talking about that which he does not know, Ryan claimed that the $2,059 more per year that families living paycheck-to-paycheck will see is extremely significant. Then he decided he had to amend that to say such savings might be nothing to a family earning $600,000 per year (true), or for people living in New York or California (false).Those are the same two states that Trump s loyal subjects insist on stripping from the 2016 vote totals to claim that Trump actually won the popular vote. Watch Ryan completely dismiss all the struggling families living in blue states below:If you re living paycheck-to-paycheck which is more than half of the people in this country and you got #2059more from a tax cut next year, that s not nothing. pic.twitter.com/8TKtrMqRa1  Paul Ryan (@SpeakerRyan) December 21, 2017Someone needs to reach through their computer or television and wipe that smugness off his face.

" WATCH: Lindsey Graham Trashes Media For Portraying Trump As ‘Kooky,’ Forgets His Own Words","The media has been talking all day about Trump and the Republican Party s scam of a tax bill; as well as the sheer obsequiousness of Trump s cabinet, and then members of Congress, after their tax scam was all but passed. But the media isn t quite saying what Trump wants. They ve been doing analysis and discussion all day long rather than praising it for the grand achievement Trump believes it is. The GOP has increasingly sounded exactly like Trump when it comes to media coverage, and coverage of the tax scam is no different. Coverage of Trump in general hasn t changed.Today, Lindsey Graham went after the media for portraying Trump as a  kook,  and unfit for office (they wouldn t be doing their job if they weren t telling the truth, though). Graham said: You know what concerns me about the American press is this endless, endless attempt to label the guy as some kind of kook; not fit to be president. Jake Tapper notes that he himself has never labeled Trump that way. But then he points out something rather odd about Graham s opinion. Take a look at the short video clip below:Lindsey Graham today: I m concerned by the media s attempt to label Trump as a kook or not fit to be President.Lindsey Graham in 2016:  I think he s a kook.

 Heiress To Disney Empire Knows GOP Scammed Us – SHREDS Them For Tax Bill,"Abigail Disney is an heiress with brass ovaries who will profit from the GOP tax scam bill but isn t into f-cking poor people over. Ms. Disney penned an op-ed for USA Today in which she rips the GOP a new one because she has  always been cognizant of income and wealth inequality.  In other words, she is not Donald Trump, Paul Ryan or Bob Corker. Or Mitch McConnell. She is Abigail Disney, dammit. Since the election of Ronald Reagan, the gap between rich and poor has grown dramatically and  trickle down  economics has turned out to cause more of a trickle up,  she writes.  But nothing has brought the problem of inequality into sharper focus for me than the current proposals by Republicans to overhaul the tax system. Disney says that this proposal will be burdensome to the middle class while decreasing  the responsibility of the wealthy to contribute to the common good. And then she dropped a truth bomb. (We like truth bombs.)Republicans insist this plan will cut taxes for the middle class, but the truth is that any meager savings will be offset by losses elsewhere   in deductions no longer allowed, loss of Medicaid and Medicare coverage, and less funding for education, all of which are on the chopping block in order to provide a tax cut for a few very wealthy people like me. There is even a tax break to private jet owners. This bill will give me this tax cut while also killing health insurance for over 13 million people,  Disney wrote.  It will let me pass over $20 million to my children, tax-free. And all my friends with private jets? They get a tax cut too. With a suffocating education system, a dying infrastructure and a national debt that will be at least $1.5 trillion bigger, that social mobility will be far out of reach for people like you,  Disney continued.  But I will be able to stay comfortably right where I am. Does that strike you as fair? No, it does not, thankyouverymuch. But given how this bill was written, I think it s looking a lot like a nightmare from Pirates of the Caribbean,  Disney wrote.  Have I made you angry yet? I really hope I ve made you angry. You should be. No one who votes for this tax bill will be voting with your life in mind. But you will pay for it.

 SNL Hilariously Mocks Accused Child Molester Roy Moore For Losing AL Senate Race (VIDEO),"Right now, the whole world is looking at the shocking fact that Democrat Doug Jones beat Republican Roy Moore in the special election to replace Attorney General Jeff Sessions in the United States Senate. Of course, Moore s candidacy was rocked by allegations of sexually harassing and even molesting teenage girls   and being banned from the mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama for doing so.Even before that, Moore was an incendiary character in Alabama politics, having been removed as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court not once but twice, and having made statements such as Muslims should not be allowed in Congress and homosexuality should be illegal. Hell, he even said that the last time America was great was when we had slavery. Therefore, he was an extraordinarily damaged candidate as it was. However, despite all of this, Alabama is a deep red state, with many voters agreeing with some of Moore s more extreme positions, and some even insisting that the allegations of sexual misconduct were simply not true. That is why it was such a shock that Doug Jones pulled out a win for that Senate seat.Well, there is one entity that could not resist going all in on the fact that Roy Moore lost this race: Saturday Night Live. While doing a caricature of the results, SNL began, with its Weekend Update host Colin Jost brutally mocking Moore s alleged proclivities fore teen girls: Congratulations to Alabama s newest Senator   not Roy Moore. Doug Jones has become the first Democrat to win a Senate seat in Alabama in over 20 years. Said Roy Moore:  gross, over 20 years? Jost then got in a dig at Trump, for whom Moore s loss was  a humiliating failure, remind everyone what Trump said of Jones  win: The Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time. It never ends! Indeed. If the sane people of America have anything to say about it, it will be a very, very long time after 2018 before the GOP is allowed to control anything. Jost continued mocking Trump: That s it? You just went all in for an accused pedophile and when he lost, [you re] just like,  well, we had fun! He could be removed from office tonight and tweet:  Congratulations to Robert Mueller on a great investigation. Had a fun time being president. Catch you on the flippity-flop! #DietCokeTime . Oh, if only that could be our reality, to have Trump congratulating Mueller for removing him and his entire treasonous, criminal administration. Until then, we ll have to stick to  Weekend Update  and the rest of SNL, and hope for the best.Watch the video below:Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images",News,"December 17, 2017"

 Meghan McCain Tweets The Most AMAZING Response To Doug Jones’ Win In Deep-Red Alabama,"As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does. Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General. And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain   John McCain s daughter. She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon  Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words. It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration. Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year. Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia. Bannon even said,  There s a special place in hell  for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls. They rejected his hate and bigotry. They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law. And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated. If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can. And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office. Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017"
 CNN CALLS IT: A Democrat Will Represent Alabama In The Senate For The First Time In 25 Years,"Alabama is a notoriously deep red state. It s a place where Democrats always think that we have zero chances of winning   especially in statewide federal elections. However, that is just what happened on Tuesday night in the Special Election to replace Senator Jeff Sessions. Doug Jones, the Democratic Senate candidate who is known in the state for prosecuting the Ku Klux Klan members who bombed a church during the Civil Rights Movement and killed four little African American girls, will be the next Senator from Alabama. CNN has just called the race, as there seems no more GOP-leaning counties out there.To contrast, Roy Moore had been twice removed from the Alabama Supreme Court as Chief Justice for violating the law, and was also credibly accused of being a sexual predator toward teen girls. Despite all of that, though, the race was a nail biter, because Moore has a long history and a deep base in Alabama. Of course, decent people   including Republicans   were horrified at the idea of a man like Roy Moore going to the Senate. Despite the allegations of sexual predation, Moore also had said many incendiary things, such as putting forth the idea that Muslims shouldn t be allowed in Congress, that homosexuality should be illegal, and that America was great when slavery was legal. And that s just for starters, too.Thank you Alabama, for letting sanity prevail in this race. Oh, and a message to Democrats   this is proof we can compete everywhere. Get a fifty state strategy going so we can blow the GOP outta the water in 2018.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"December 12, 2017"

The Fox host is trying to discredit the FBI and we re wondering where the  Blue Lives Matter  crowd is as she tries to take down law enforcement officials. On Saturday night, Pirro said there needs to be a  cleansing  at the FBI and the Department of Justice.Pirro claims that quite a few officials are protecting Hillary Clinton   who does not hold public office   or are destroying Donald Trump, and singled out Deputy Director of the FBI Andrew McCabe, FBI official Peter Strzok, former Associate Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr, former FBI Director James Comey and you guessed it: Special Counsel Robert Mueller   all of whom she says need to be arrested and placed in handcuffs. There have been times in our history where corruption and lawlessness were so pervasive, that examples had to be made,  she shrieked.  This is one of those times.

For that, he was sentenced to spend over two years  locked up  in prison for improperly deducting $1.2 million of his personal expenses as business write-offs while living a lavish lifestyle. Mr. Pirro was convicted on all 34 counts.Pirro split with her hubby after he admitted to fathering a child with another woman. He told the press and Pirro failed to give him enough attention. I know! Maybe if he changed his name to Hillary Clinton then he d get all the attention he needs.Pirro s hatred for Hillary Clinton goes way back and it appears to stem from jealousy.Maybe Pirro should heed the advice from Pirro in 2016 when she said,  We cannot have a country run by a president subject to ongoing criminal investigations, potential indictments and never-ending hearings [W]hether she s indicted or even guilty, it doesn t matter.

" BREAKING: Cop Finally Gets His Due, Walter Scott’s Killer Sentenced To Prison (DETAILS)","In America, we have been having a conversation about police brutality against black Americans. Despite the countless black people murdered unjustly by police, there is usually no justice. Sandra Bland, Philando Castile, Keith Lamont Scott, Michael Brown, Freddie Gray too many to mention here, really. All of those people were senselessly murdered by cops who chose to be their judges, juries, and executioners, and they did so with impunity and without consequence. However, there is hope, and it is coming out of South Carolina, of all places.North Charleston police officer Michael Slager murdered Walter Scott, a black man who was fleeing after a routine traffic stop in cold blood in 2015. He would have gotten away with it, too, had it not been for a citizen who was brave enough to tape the murder. The tape showed that Slager had lied about his life being in danger, and it showed him cuffing Scott s lifeless body, and then planting a taser as  evidence.  Here is the news report of that damning tape:Thanks to that tape, Slager was arrested and charged with murder. Now, fast forward two years later, and Slager has been convicted of murder. U.S. District Judge David Norton decided to throw the book at Slager, and sentenced the murdering ex-cop to 19-24 years in prison.The original case ended in a mistrial, but the state of South Carolina seemed determined to get justice for Walter Scott, and that happened on December 7, 2017.  Of course, Slager s family begged for mercy from the judge, but luckily those calls were ignored. Michael Slager is a murderer, and he deserves the sentence he got.So many times, these cases end with the murderous cops back on the force, out in the streets after what amounts to nothing more than a paid vacation, free to murder another black person at will again. Thankfully, for once, the system worked as it should. For once, I am proud to be a South Carolinian. Hopefully this sets a precedent, and helps us turn a corner toward the arc of justice.Watch the video of the remarks of the Scott family below: Featured image via Grace Beahm-Pool/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017"
 Watch: Is This Proof Trump Is Unfit for Service?,"New questions are being asked about President Donald Trump s ability to lead after he slurred his words during a speech about his Jerusalem decision. Possible reasons for this include: fatigue, a dry mouth (the White House explanation), the use of drugs or alcohol, a problem with his dentures or more troubling issues dealing with his mental or physical health. Morning Joe reported this morning that, unlike other presidents, Trump has opted not to get his physicals at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center.Questions about Trump s mental stability have been growing over the last few months. While he has never been viewed as a stable person in the traditional sense, his tweets and comments have gotten more erratic. He was widely criticized recently when he retweeted several anti-Muslim videos that were posted by radicals in the United Kingdom.One psychiatrist talk to MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnel about his impressions of Trump s state of mind.Many think that any degradation in Trump s mental state may be due to the increased pressure he is feeling from Robert Mueller s investigations into collusion between his campaign and the Russian government. This has increased since former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI.All of this talk is leading to more people to ask if Trump should be removed from office, citing the 25th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Rep. Jamie D. Raskin (D-MD) has circulated a  dear colleague  letter suggesting just that. As published in the Washington Post, it says: Please join a rapidly growing group of colleagues in cosponsoring H.R. 1987, the Oversight Commission on Presidential Capacity Act. It sets up and defines the Congressionally-appointed  body  called for by the 25th Amendment. Under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment, the Vice-President and a majority of the Cabinet or the Vice-President and a majority of  such other body as Congress may by law provide  can determine that the President is for reasons of physical or mental incapacity unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office. The 25th Amendment was added to the Constitution in 1967, but in the last 50 years Congress never created the  body  that its language contemplated. Perhaps it never occurred to prior Congresses that setting up this body was necessary. For obvious reasons, it is indeed necessary, and now is the time for us to do it. While the Republicans in the Cabinet and Congress may not yet be ready to take this step, it is out there.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images",News,"December 7, 2017"
" Sitting GOP Senator Has Had ENOUGH, Donates To Alabama Democrat For Senate (IMAGE)","Arizona Republican Senator Jeff Flake has never been a fan of Donald Trump or his incendiary, divisive brand of politics. Now, he is a leading GOP voice against electing Roy Moore (R-AL) to the United States Senate. Moore is an accused child molester, and has a lifetime history of making all kinds of bigoted and incendiary comments. He has said that homosexuality should be illegal, and that Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. Moore was also removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for refusing to comply with higher court rulings. Well, Flake has finally had enough of his party enabling characters like Moore. He had already said that if he lived in Alabama, he d be voting for Democrat Doug Jones. Now, Flake  has taken his support of Jones even further, in the wake of the Republican National Committee s decision to support an accused child molester rather than a Democrat.Taking to Twitter, Senator Flake posted an image of a check   made out to Doug Jones  Senate campaign. Here is the tweet, captioned  Country over Party :Country over Party pic.twitter.com/JZMTaEYdxQ  Jeff Flake (@JeffFlake) December 5, 2017Now, I don t agree with Jeff Flake on anything politically, but I can say that he is trying to act with morality and decency here. One could argue that Flake s plans to retire from the Senate mean that he can do this without consequence, but at this point, that matters not. We do not need a pedophile in the United States Senate, and the GOP apparatus should be ashamed of themselves for trying to get Roy Moore elected.

 Donald Trump’s Eating Habits Could Be Dramatically Affecting His Wellbeing And Our Safety,"We ve all heard the stories of Donald Trump preferring a well-done steak with ketchup and shunning any new delicacies, despite living a lifestyle that offers him all the luxuries one could ever desire, however, it s not just that the President has terrible gastronomical taste, a new memoir suggests that his diet is one of several poor lifestyle choices that could very well shorten his life.According to an excerpt from Let Trump be Trump, an upcoming book by Trump s former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and aide David Bossie, we get to enter the inner circle where the President of the United States having a 2,400-calorie McDonald s dinner is par for the course. Trump s appetite seems to know no bounds when it comes to McDonald s, with a dinner order consisting of two Big Macs, two Filet-O-Fish, and a chocolate malted,  is just one of the claims made in the book. To put that meal in perspective, Trump s dinner contains 3,400 grams of sodium, despite the American Heart Foundation recommending just 1,500 grams per day, plus enough white bread to last most people a week. Remember, this is just one meal, but it only gets worse. On Trump Force One there were four major food groups: McDonald s, Kentucky Fried Chicken, pizza, and Diet Coke,  the authors write about traveling with Trump during the early days of his presidency, but there may be a valid reason for it   Not only is he a fan of manufacturing, Trump is also a renowned germaphobe who allegedly won t eat from a package that has already been opened, which would also explain the plane s cupboards being stacked with Vienna Fingers, potato chips, pretzels, and many packages of Oreos.  Those well-done steaks make a little more sense now, as well. But a little bit of bacteria is probably the least of the President s worries. This is a 71-year-old man who gets next to no exercise (it s hard to include his golf when he barely even walks while playing), gets very little sleep, and is constantly throwing tantrums, so add in that diet and you have the perfect recipe for a heart attack. The diet alone, especially the snacks, is almost an open-invite for diabetes, too.What makes this frightening for the rest of us is that this is a man who is currently responsible for a nuclear standoff with North Korea, as well as dealing with rapidly warming oceans and an ever-increasing tax bill. If he has this lack of concern for his own wellbeing, then what does it say of his risk-assessment abilities?Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"December 5, 2017"
 ‘Ghost Of Witness Flipped’: Hilarious SNL Skit Takes Trump Into His Own Private Holiday Hell (VIDEO),"By now, everyone knows that disgraced National Security Adviser Michael Flynn has flipped on Donald Trump. Of course, the good folks at Saturday Night Live, who have been mocking Trump relentlessly, couldn t resist using this to needle the notoriously thin -skinned, sorry excuse for a  president.  It also helps that we are in the midst of the holiday season, which enabled SNL to use a seasonal classic, A Christmas Carol, to poke fun at Trump.Alec Baldwin took up the mantle to play Trump again, who is visited by a fictional Michael Flynn (Mikey Day) in chains, and seems positively terrified of the Ghost of Michael Flynn, who appears to tell Trump, it s time to come clean for the good of the country.  After that, the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future line up to torture Trump in the Oval Office.The Ghost of Christmas Past is fired NBC host Billy Bush (Alex Moffat), of Trump s infamous  grab em by the pussy  tape. Then it was time for a shirtless Vladimir Putin (Beck Bennet) to arrive, to remind Trump of the fact that he wouldn t be president without help from the Russian government, and that he s about to have all of their efforts be for naught. The Ghost of Christmas Future is the best of all, with a positively wickedly delicious version of Hillary Clinton, played by Kate McKinnon, who gleefully says to Trump: You Donald, have given me the greatest Christmas gift of all! You have no idea how long I ve wanted to say this,  lock him up! Lock him up indeed. This entire criminal administration belongs in jail. It will go from Flynn, to Pence, to Trump Jr., and then to Trump himself   and then Hillary will really have the last laugh.",News,"December 3, 2017"

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue,  he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a  wonderful man. I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media   as I call it, the fake media, in many cases,  Trump said in February.  I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly. When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to  let go  of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.

 White House Panics Knowing Flynn Is Going To Take Them Down,"While Donald Trump has been taking vacations, special counsel Robert Mueller has been working hard on the Russia investigation. Instead of golfing this weekend, we suggest that the former reality show star huddle with his lawyers. Trump s former national security adviser Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador and he s fully cooperating with Mueller. As part of the plea deal, Flynn admitted that he was directed by a senior member of the Trump transition team to make contact with Russian officials in December. In addition, Flynn is prepared to testify that Trump as a candidate, ordered him to make contacts with the Russians.This marks the first instance of solid proof that there was collusion between team Trump and a hostile foreign government.On Friday, just after the news broke, the White House insisted that Flynn s guilty plea will not implicate Trump or anyone else in the White House.The White House said in a statement that Flynn was fired for making false statements to Trump officials, and that he worked for the administration for a short time   and that he was a former Obama administration official. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year,  said White House lawyer Ty Cobb.  Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The White House then referred to Flynn as the  former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days  as well as  a former Obama administration official. However, the White House left out a few important details. President Obama fired Flynn as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency and he also warned Trump about Flynn during a discussion two days after the election and emphasized that he had concerns about him joining the national security team for the new president.On top of that, just after Flynn was forced to resign, Trump called him a  wonderful man  who was treated unfairly by the media.Photo by David Becker/Getty Images.",News,"December 1, 2017"

If he wants to talk about attendance, we can discuss his unenthusiastic inauguration crowd size. As for his ratings, he ranks as the least popular president in the history of polling.Donald Trump is actively trying to divide our country even more than it already is.

 Pro-Trump Group Is Now Using Pictures Of An Obama Rally To Make Trump Look Popular,"In their pathetic attempt to pass the deeply unpopular and unfair tax bill that Republicans in Congress have been working on, the GOP has pulled out all the stops   and so have outside spending groups.Every campaign season, America is inundated with ad after ad claiming that one candidate or the other will be either the nation s savior or its downfall. But when ads start popping up for legislation, you know the party that s pushing it is desperate for support.America First Policies, a pro-Trump organization that calls itself a non-profit just because they legally can, has come up with a new ad intended to convince Americans to call their members of Congress and demand that they vote yes on the upcoming tax nightmare. We know it s a nightmare because the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office just scored the bill on Sunday night, and said that the legislation, which has had ZERO hearings, raises taxes on the poor, cuts taxes on the rich, and cripples Obamacare by repealing the individual mandate that makes the system function.The ad is a clever bit of doublespeak itself, as is everything that Republicans say when it comes to taxes. They have promoted the utterly debunked theory of  trickle-down  economics for more than three decades, and for all of their posturing, not a single dime of tax cuts for corporations and the super-wealthy has ever  trickled down  in the form of economic stimulus or higher pay for workers   as they perennially promise that it will.But it s an image that AFP uses in the ad that s catching people s attention.Watch the ad and see if you catch something that looks familiar:Check out our NEW TV ADThis is our once in a generation opportunity to CUT TAXES for the Middle Class.

 Principles Over Power: Why Republicans Need To Do What’s Right To Remain Relevant,"Over the last few weeks, I ve watched as the last shreds of the Republican Party s  family values  rotted away.As Alabama voters prepare to go to the polls in December they have two choices before them.They can vote for the Democrat and prove that they refuse to tolerate an accused child molester and sexual predator being in their party and in the Senate, or they can put political power over the morality they have long preached about.In other words, they can either put power over principles or put principles over power.They can t do both.And while they are damned if they do and damned if they don t, choosing the latter of those two options would be a far better and more honorable choice.Some things go above politics, and sexual assault is, and rightfully should, be one of them.Voting for Moore for the sake of political power throws every sexual assault victim under the bus. It will especially be a slap in the face of women across the country, a major voting block that has already been overwhelmingly voting Democrat for many years.If Republicans want to have any chance of surviving as a legitimate political party for many more decades to come, it is critical that they start by drawing a line in the sand when it comes to Moore and the people who defend him such as Donald Trump.This starting point alone can restore a little of the respect the GOP has lost. Perhaps then, they ll even be courageous enough to rejects the racists and the sexists and the Nazis, which will do more to grow the ranks of the party than the Southern Strategy ever did.And then the Republican Party can get past being a haven for extremists and anti-government zealots and get on the road to becoming a sane party with real ideas instead of simply opposing and obstructing at every turn, which has not been good for the country at all.America has lost its respect of the international community and our reputation has been seriously sullied. Letting Moore step inside the Senate would send a message to the world that America supports child molestation and the sexual assault and harassment of women.Such a message from the Republican Party smacks of hypocrisy. After all, we are talking about the same party that constantly bring up the sexual assault allegations against Bill Clinton.But just like how they constantly bring up Abraham Lincoln in an attempt to claim that the Republican Party must still be great, their rhetoric about Bill Clinton is old and tired and not really that relevant today. The GOP is far removed from the days of Lincoln. And Bill Clinton was president two decades ago and if he were running today he would not win. The sexual assault allegations alone would prevent him from even getting on the ballot.However, by supporting Donald Trump, who was accused by a dozen women of sexual assault during the 2016 campaign, Republicans committed a serious hypocrisy that undermines their Bill Clinton talking point.If Moore wins next month, Republicans will only be doubling down on that hypocrisy and they ll be past the point of no return. And the consequences will be severe.America is more diverse than ever before. Women have emerged as a force to be reckoned with after decades of old white guys running the show. Minorities are also set to become the majority of the population, and once that scale tips, the GOP will no longer be able to be the party of white people. It just won t work.It s just a matter of time, and time is running out for the Republican Party.And that s why they must rise above politics and stand for something bigger than themselves.Sexual assault and child molestation should not be rewarded with power and prestige. And that should go beyond the political arena as well, whether the behavior is coming from a corporate CEO or the part-owner of a website or a church leader or any other position of power.Republicans need to start practicing the  morality  they preach and they can do that by putting politics aside and do the right thing.That s what Republicans did in 1860 when they voted for a dark horse candidate as their flagbearer. Lincoln then put politics aside to assemble one of the greatest Cabinets in our history, bringing together liberal and conservative Republicans and even a Democrat or two.And even though Lincoln remained neutral at first and the politics of day made it really difficult, he made the decision to put politics aside and pushed for the passage of the 13th Amendment. Such a move at the time could have cost Lincoln a second term, but he did it anyway.Lincoln put principle over power in the face of an even more contentious and hateful political environment than we are experiencing today. It s time for Republicans to do the same now.Seven years ago, my first article for this site explained how Republicans have put power over principles for decades to the detriment of our progress towards a better future for everyone.Today, I want inform my loyal readers that this will be my final article for Addicting Info.It has been an honor and a privilege to write here for so many years. I must first thank my readers for making this job possible. Knowing that I was informing so many people across the country and around the world motivated me to make writing about politics my career.

 Trump: Everything You Heard Me Say On The Access Hollywood Tape Never Happened,"Former reality show star Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to be held responsible for the words that come out of his own mouth, even when it s on tape. For example, the infamous Access Hollywood tape in which he suggests that because he s powerful, he can just grab women by their p-ssies. Trump defended sexual harasser and Fox News host (yeah, I know that s redundant) Bill O Reilly in the recent past and even more recently, he has defended alleged pedophile and Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. So, defending perverts is just another day for Donald Trump.Here s a quick reminder of what Trump said on the p*ssy grabbing tape: You know I m automatically attracted to beautiful [women]   I just start kissing them. It s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don t even wait. And when you re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything. The New York Times reports that even after Trump made an almost-apology after the tape was revealed, he still told a Senator and an adviser that the Access Hollywood tape may not be authentic.But something deeper has been consuming Mr. Trump. He sees the calls for Mr. Moore to step aside as a version of the response to the now-famous  Access Hollywood  tape, in which he boasted about grabbing women s genitalia, and the flood of groping accusations against him that followed soon after. He suggested to a senator earlier this year that it was not authentic, and repeated that claim to an adviser more recently.So, to reiterate, Trump told an adviser recently that the video and tape of him talking about perving on women is fake news. And he also told that to a Senator after it was released.We see a pattern here. Maybe Trump s cult-like following will believe this crap but the rest of us remember that tape all too well. That tape was an indicating factor that Donald J. Trump is unfit for office, morally and intellectually.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 25, 2017"
" Gay GOP Operative Endorses Doug Jones Over ‘Bigoted, Deviant’ Roy Moore In Senate Race (VIDEO)","The Republican Party has a Roy Moore problem. Even before it came out that the judge turned Alabama Senate candidate is accused of being a child molester, he was a problem. He had been removed twice from the Alabama Supreme Court for flagrantly defying the law. Moore has said Muslims should not be allowed to serve in Congress. He waved a gun around on stage at a campaign rally and rode a horse to the polls in Alabama to vote for himself in the primary he would eventually win against establishment-backed interim Senator Luther Strange. Well, it seems that with all of this and then some, sane Republicans have had enough of Roy Moore. One such person is former Jeb Bush campaign strategist Tim Miller. He  has a solution to his party s Roy Moore problem: Vote for the Democrat, Doug Jones, to keep Roy Moore the hell away from the United States Senate.Miller happens to be gay, so of course Moore s disgusting homophobia is a problem for him. Then there is, of course, the child molesting. In a column for the left-wing site Crooked Media entitled  The Republican Case for Doug Jones,  Miller says of his decision, which he calls,  obvious : But here we are in the dark abyss of 2017, and in this political moment, child exploitation attempted child rape, even has become a partisan issue. President Donald Trump is even cool with it, as long as the sex predator is on his team. A comrade in genital grabbing if you will. So after Trump essentially re-endorsed Alabama s Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, this particular child predator, on Tuesday, I took what I thought was an obvious step. I donated to the other guy s campaign. But in this instance there was one wrinkle for me. The other guy, Doug Jones, is a Democrat. And I a Republican political operative have never donated to one of those before. Thus, in sharing the fact that I had made the donation on social media, I also noted that this was a first for me, even though it felt extremely obvious. Here is the tweet where Tim Miller announces his crossover:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well. Enough is enough. https://t.co/YlDXTXSnyJ  Tim Miller (@Timodc) November 21, 2017Tim Miller is right. Roy Moore is absolutely deplorable, and should be nowhere near the United States Senate. This isn t politics, it s morals. Now, it is time for more sane, reasonable Republicans to get out there and do the unthinkable   reject a child molester and endorse and donate to the man who prosecuted the Ku Klux Klan while Roy Moore was busy creeping on little girls. It s not that hard.Watch the video of Tim Miller s appearance on The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 23, 2017"
 New Accuser Confirms She Got Roy Moore Banned From The Mall (VIDEOS),"Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) has a mounting list of women who say that he sexually harassed or assaulted them when they were teenagers. Another piece of that story is the rumor that Moore was so creepy with the girls that he was banned from a local mall in his hometown of Gadsden, Alabama. That rumor had been unsubstantiated   until now.Becky Gray was working at the Gadsden Mall when she encountered Roy Moore, then an assistant district attorney. She was in her early 20 s, and he was in his 30 s. She said that Moore had taken a  creepy  liking to her, and constantly visited her at the mall. According to Gray, Moore hung out at the mall on Friday and Saturday nights   like teenagers do. She says of the situation: I mean, you ve got to understand   when you re that age, somebody in their 30s might as well have been 40 or 50   to me anyway. He d come back through [the department store] and if I was working, he would stop by and chit chat and that sort of thing, and it just kind of got creepy to me. Every Friday and Saturday night, he was down at the mall. Nobody his age is at the mall! You know, parents are dropping off their 12 year olds and 13 year olds, 14 year olds. I mean, come on, I just thought that was really creepy even way back then. Roy Moore repeatedly harassed Becky Gray at work, and she went to her manager about his behavior: I went to my manager and talked to him about it and asked him, basically, what could be done. Later on, he came back through my department and told me that [Moore] had been banned from the mall. In addition to Becky Gray s account, there is an account that Moore was banned from the mall by a man named Greg Legat who also worked there at the time. Here is video of his confirmation:So, every bit of this is true, in other words. Roy Moore actually hung out at the mall in order to creep on little girls and young women working there or hanging out there with their friends. This man is completely unfit to be a United States Senator, and if the people of Alabama elect him, he should be immediately expelled.Here is video of Becky Gray s account of Moore s mall banning, via ABC News:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"November 17, 2017"

Roy Moore has tried to compare his scandal to Franken s inappropriate behavior, but only one of the men admitted they were wrong, called for an investigation, and apologized. Only one man perved on high school girls, one as young as 14-years-old. We re not justifying Franken s behavior. We re simply saying that Moore, a staunch right-wing Christian, has failed to admit to any wrongdoing, despite the fact that there are nine accusers and at least 30 people to corroborate the alleged victims  stories. At least Franken admitted what happened and he took the steps to immediately address the accusations.Photo by Molly Riley-Pool/Getty Images",News,"November 16, 2017"
 That Time Trump Mocked Marco Rubio For Drinking Water Just Came Back To Haunt Him,"While on the campaign trail, candidate Donald Trump, a former reality show star, repeatedly mocked Sen. Marco Rubio for that time he drank water on the stage. Trump mocked Rubio at rallies about that and on Twitter, too. As they say, with this guy, there really is a tweet for everything. Trump did this after he kicked off his day blasting that  loser  network CNN, the  failing  New York Times and demanded a  thank you  from the UCLA basketball players who arrived in the states after being released from China. Then he summarized his trip to Asia, declaring it to be  the longest visit to the region by an American president in more than a quarter of a century.  He added that  America is back and the future has never looked better.

 WATCH: Corporate CEOs SHOCK Trump’s Economic Adviser With Truth About GOP Tax Cuts,"Trump s economic adviser, Gary Cohn, has bought into the GOP s tax plan lock, stock and barrel to the point where he likely has a deep belief that trickle-down economics actually works. The thing is, it doesn t, and at a Wall Street Journal event packed full of CEOs, Cohn seemed absolutely stunned that this crowd of corporate leaders wouldn t automatically say they d use the GOP s tax cuts to invest in their own companies.An editor from the Wall Street Journal asked the audience: If the tax reform bill goes through, do you plan to increase investment   your company s investment, capital investment? Only a few of them raised their hands indicating they would. Cohn s response was: Why aren t the other hands up? Really? Well, yes, really. It seems so easy to Cohn, apparently. One might even think that he genuinely doesn t understand why most of the CEOs in the room kept their hands down. Cohn now looks incredibly ignorant and stupid.Corporate tax cuts do not result in greater capital investment and these CEOs know it. Anybody who knows anything about business and economics (and even modern history) knows it. It s really quite simple: CEOs will not invest in things like new machinery, new factories, or new jobs when they don t have enough customer demand to justify it.In fact, most money saved from these kinds of tax cuts go toward stock buybacks, which is a controversial practice in which a company buys back its own stock to artificially drive prices up and put more money into the pockets of shareholders and the C-suite. CEO pay also tends to go up when taxes go down.CEOs know this. They want the tax cuts for precisely this reason. Their greed has gotten the best of them and they know tax cuts will make them richer. But they can t, and won t, commit to using the money they ll save on taxes to expanding operations and creating jobs because if they do, they create a PR nightmare for themselves.Watch Cohn get shocked below:1. Tax-overhaul backers say corporate rate cut will encourage investment by businesses 2. During #wsjceocouncil interview with Gary Cohn, WSJ asks CEOs to raise hands if they ll boost investment if rates cut 3. Few CEOS raise hands 4.

 WATCH: Delusional Trump Fans Lash Out At Fox Host For Reporting Facts Of Uranium One Deal,"Clearly, Trump supporters want Fox News to lie to them.Because when Fox News host Shep Smith fact-checked Donald Trump s accusations against Hillary Clinton in regards to the Uranium One deal with Russia, they lost their shit.Smith thoroughly debunked Republican claims that Hillary Clinton approved the deal in a pay-to-play scam during her time as Secretary of State back in 2010.First, the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads, who unanimously approved.Second, the State Department was represented by an assistant who says Clinton did not intervene.Third, the Uranium One deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the United States, which blows Trump s claim that Hillary gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia out of the water.Fourth, one man gave the Clinton Foundation all but $4 million of the $140 million donated by nine individuals associated with Uranium One. And that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in 2007, well before Clinton even thought about being Secretary of State. And long before Barack Obama became president to make her Secretary of State.And, finally, Clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself.So, that means conservatives have no case against Clinton, effectively neutering any effort by the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts. And the facts support Clinton. So much so, that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court.Here s the video via YouTube.In response, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for Fox to fire Smith for reporting the facts.You need to get that hack @ShepNewsTeam out of Fox. He just made excuses for #CrookedHillary and is clearly a double agent. Hey Shep.. Hillary took the 145M regardless of when it was sent. Pay for play you goof  Lab Lover (@Dutchistheballs) November 14, 2017Chris Wallace and Shepard Smith should start a show on CNN called ""Pink Hat Brigade"" that's where you both belong.

He is arrogant and clearly anti trump  Jim Hennahane (@limabean002) November 14, 2017And these are just a few of the MANY angry conservative tweets calling for Smith to be fired. However, a majority of the tweets came in support of Smith and his fact-based reporting, which blew apart the rest of the network s effort to spin the deal into a nefarious scandal proving that Hillary colluded with the Russians.Seriously.Shep Smith did his job as a journalist. Sean Hannity could certainly learn a lot from Smith. The Uranium One scandal being pushed by Trump and his minions has been repeatedly debunked. Conservatives are desperately attacking Clinton to distract from Trump s real scandals. But Smith refuses to lie to make Trump look good. And that s the real reason why Trump supporters hate him so much.Featured Image: Screenshot ",News,"November 15, 2017"
 Roy Moore Supporting Republican LOSES It After Being Called An Extremist,"If the scandal around the stories of Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore s accusations of dating of teenage girls is accomplishing anything, it s drawing a line in the sand. Republicans are having to declare themselves either pro-pedophilia or anti.You d think it would be an easy choice to make, but hey, we have an accused pedophile in the White House, so maybe not so easy for the GOP party. Even Ted Cruz, though, who is one of the most extreme in Washington (and one of the most loathed) has withdrawn his support of Moore.One Republican, though, is holding on and he s shocked (I tell you) that anyone would ever call him an extremist over it.Rob Maness, who has the endorsement of Sarah Palin, Rand Paul, Rick Perry and Ben Carson, is running for the Louisiana State House. During a radio interview, a caller called Maness  an extremist,  precisely because he s to the right of Ted Cruz, at least on the subject of statutory rape.The caller went by the moniker of  flaming liberal  for WGSO-AM. His real name, though, is David Bellinger. He said about Maness,  If you re to the right of Ted Cruz, you re an extremist.  Hard to argue that since there is pretty much no one more extreme than Cruz, who believes that Planned Parenthood sells body parts and that the states can ignore the Supreme Court s ruling making gay marriage legal. Maness was having none of that accusation. Whoa, you just called me an extremist, brother,  said Maness, a retired Air Force colonel who went on to outline his military background, including top-secret clearances. I ve done everything this country has ever asked me to do. How dare you call me an extremist,  he said.  I m the most investigated, stable man that the country could have ever given the keys to nuclear weapons to, so you can blow me! You can blow me and get out of here if you re gonna talk like that and call me an extremist. Source: The AdvocateJust two things here: Maness is not running for an office where he would get the keys to nuclear weapons and well, his answer doesn t make him seem a very  stable man. Bellinger shot back, Go screw your ma, asshole,  several times.Maness, still fuming, said: I m not going to listen to that crap,  he said after jettisoning Bellinger.  Nobody s gonna call me an extremist, because I m not one. The extremists are the people who are liars, and the hypocrites and the swamp creatures from Washington, D.C. and Baton Rouge and all around the nation, even at the local level, that have got their political power and they try to smear people like me because we want to take it away from them.

 This 4-Year Old Tweet From Donald Trump Shows Us He’s AT LEAST As Perverted As Roy Moore,"After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore  dated  them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the  well regulated militia  part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that  if  the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it  talent  to  date  a woman who s young enough to be his daughter. Note: he was married to Melania at the time.@rexrode_lisa ""@realDonaldTrump you date girls young enough to be your daughter.That's perverted"" Dated. No, that's talent.  Donald J.

A poll taken after the accusations began to surface showed Moore with a 10 point lead against his Democratic opponent, Doug Jones. If we haven t thrown in the moral towel as a country, Republicans certainly have.

 WATCH: Christian Right Founder Condemns Them For Supporting Nazis And Sexual Misconduct,"The religious right movement is not the same movement anymore.And Frank Schaeffer would know. After all, he helped his father create it.The movement originally began as an anti-abortion organization specifically designed to bring angry Christians to the voting booth. But has since become something even more insidious.In recent years, conservative  Christians  have become one giant hate group that supports Nazism and rape while working to strip women, minorities and gay people of their constitutional rights.During an appearance on AM Joy on Saturday, Schaeffer roundly condemned the Christian Right and the Republican Party in a smack down of Biblical proportion taking particular aim at Roy Moore and Donald Trump, whom conservatives are supporting despite several sexual abuse and assault allegations against them and Trump s own refusal to condemn Nazis. Back in the day when my dad and me were going around the country establishing the religious right based on our anti-abortion stand, one I ve moved a long way from since, the whole idea was bringing America back to some moral stand,  Schaeffer began. Think about the Republican Party now,  Schaeffer continued.  Throw some words out that are associated with them: mass shootings, Milo, Trump, Moore, Bannon, rape, child molesting, neo-Nazis, white supremacy. What the hell is going on with the Republican Party? I m not shocked by Donald Trump, he s an ass. I m not shocked by Roy Moore. he s a loud mouth, a gun-toting fool. What I m shocked by is the complicity. We are in a political climate that s built on one lie after another. I just want to say for the record, by the way, I believe a woman who stands up, which is very difficult to do and comes forward with a story like that. She was a Trump voter. She s a Republican. I believe her. I just want to say that as a father and grandfather and someone that respects women that I believe her. Here s the video via YouTube.Conservative  Christians  and Republicans should pay attention to what Schaeffer says. Clearly, the movement he helped create has turned into a monster that is far removed from the teachings of Jesus and the Bible. That is evidenced by the fact that conservatives are perverting the Bible to defend Moore s predatory behavior.It s time for the American people to wake up and put an end to the Christian Right. They have never represented the values of the American people and they work every day to undermine our nation in an effort to turn it into their perverted and hateful version of a Christian utopia. Their insanity must be stopped.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"November 11, 2017"

Mnuchin s wife, Scottish actress Louise Linton, is next in line, just holding on for dear life, with Education Secretary Nancy DeVos at the end throwing some money into the air as well. Former HHS Secretary Tom Price can also be seen plummeting to earth, an obvious reference to the ex-congressman s unexpected departure from the Trump administration. The inclusion of Mnuchin, Linton, and Price is also most likely in reference to the scandals they ve faced in regards to taxpayer-funded air travel.Things only get worse for Trump and his cabinet once the reader opens the issue. In a cover story written by Alexander Nazaryan titled  Trump is Leading the Most Corrupt Administration in U.S. History, One of First-Class Kleptocrats,  Trump s cabinet is exposed for their use of taxpayer money for lavish and completely unnecessary expenses such as vacations and extra security detail. Ironic, considering Trump s campaign promise was to  drain the swamp,  vowing to cleanse the government of corruption. [Trump s Cabinet] were people, we d been told, who were sacrificing lucrative private-sector posts to work in the service of the American people,  Nazaryan writes in the article.  Now, those very same  forgotten Americans were paying for [Secretary of the Treasury Steven] Mnuchin, worth as much as $500 million, because he apparently didn t want to go through airport security.

" Maine Voters Tell Trump To Go F*ck Himself, Expand Medicaid Through Obamacare","Republicans should be downright afraid to try killing Obamacare ever again.As we all know, Donald Trump has been urging Republicans in Congress to pass legislation that would strip healthcare from over 20 million Americans.Not only do Trump and his Republican allies want to kill Obamacare, they want to end Medicaid as we know it. Indeed, Medicaid would become a death panel where the state would decide what kind of healthcare people get.As Trump s effort to kill Obamacare gets more desperate, the landmark healthcare program gets more popular, enough so, that a few Republicans have broken ranks to oppose repeal.In fact, Medicaid expansion is so popular that Maine voters overruled Governor Paul LePage s veto on Tuesday via the ballot.According to Reuters,Tuesday s ballot asked Maine voters to approve or reject a plan to provide healthcare coverageunder Medicaid for adults under the age of 65 with incomes at or below 138 percent of the federal poverty level, which in 2017 is about $16,000 for a single person and about $22,000 for a family of two.And 60 percent of Maine voters approved, clearly rejecting LePage s and Trump s efforts to kill Medicaid and Obamacare.70,000 Mainers will now be eligible for Medicaid coverage and will get the healthcare they need and deserve.This is huge because Maine is often considered politically independent to conservative leaning, meaning that Republicans would be better off abandoning their war on healthcare.If they don t, voters across the country will go to the ballot box and replace them with lawmakers who actually give a damn about them and their health.And Trump could be on the path to being a one-term president, assuming he isn t impeached or arrested before 2020.And he ll have no one to blame but himself. Because people don t like it when politicians try to kill them.Featured Image: White House Photo by Pete Souza",News,"November 8, 2017"

 Trump Just Openly Called For A Third World War (VIDEO),"You know all those fears conservatives dismiss that Trump is going to get us into another world war? Well, those concerns are very real based on what he just said at a press conference in Seoul, South Korea. It s time to act with urgency and with great determination,  Trump said during the press conference.  North Korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action. We call on every responsible nation including China and Russia to demand that the North Korean regime end its nuclear weapons and its missile programs,  The Donald said. The United States stands prepared to defend itself and its allies using the full range of our unmatched military capabilities if need be,  Trump said, desperately trying to  wag the dog  in an effort to distract from the mounting criminal indictments of his associates.Is it any wonder that seemingly more South Koreans showed up to protest Trump than Americans attended his inauguration?

 Trump Is Trying To Make Facebook Give Him Personal Info Of People Who Criticize Him,"Lawyers for the Trump administration have served Facebook with three separate search warrants, demanding the private account information of users who could be described in their words as  anti-administration activists who have spoken out at organized events, and who are generally very critical of this administration s policies.  Read: Trump critics, and this has the potential to affect thousands of Facebook users.Fortunately, the American Civil Liberties Union filed a motion to quash the warrants on Thursday on behalf of three Facebook users. What is particularly chilling about these warrants is that anti-administration political activists are going to have their political associations and views scrutinized by the very administration they are protesting,  said ACLU attorney Scott Michelman.One such user is Emmelia Talarico. Talarico operated the disruptj20 page where other users could discuss and organize protests for Trump s Inauguration Day. If the search warrants are passed and Facebook is required to hand over the information, the government would have access to the identities of the estimated 6,000 users who visited the page. Talarico says if her account information were given to the government, officials would have access to her  personal passwords, security questions and answers, and credit card information,  plus  the private lists of invitees and attendees to multiple political events sponsored by the page. Facebook was first served the warrants back in February and they came with a gag order preventing the social media giant from alerting the three users in question about the government seeking their personal information. Michelman claims that government attorneys dropped the gag order earlier this month, allowing Facebook to expose the existence of the warrants, however, all court filings and any response from Facebook are still deemed confidential.The warrants also seek the personal information from the accounts of Lacy MacAuley and Legba Carrefour. Carrefour, a self-described political activist, acknowledges that he has participated in or helped to organize dozens of demonstrations and events of various types in service of political causes,  but is also concerned about the warrants because his Facebook account  contains a significant amount of private material concerning my personal life.

 Trump Tells Japanese Diplomats He Never Knew There Were So Many Countries In The World,"Who knew that presidenting would be so hard, right? Conservatives voted a former reality show star into power with zero experience in politics and they thought that would be a good thing. Donald Trump has always claimed to have a high IQ, even going as far as to offer to compare IQ tests with Rex Tillerson after reports surfaced that the secretary of State had called him a  fucking moron.  But we d really like that to happen because while Trump is on his 13-day trip overseas, he revealed to Japanese dignitaries that he didn t know how many countries there are in the world until he became the so-called president.First, Japanese Prime Minister Abe gave his remarks in front of the crowded room, then Trump got up to the mic to be sure to embarrass the U.S.   again. So my relationship with Shinzo got off to quite a rocky start because I never ran for office, and here I am,  Trump told the room.  But I never ran, so I wasn t very experienced. And after I had won, everybody was calling me from all over the world. I never knew we had so many countries. Trump kicked off his remarks by calling Prime Minister Abe by his first name.Trump s remarks start around the 14- minute mark:It s kind of an important thing to know, don t you think? Especially if you re supposed to be the leader of the free world.For the record, there are 193 UN member states, plus the State of Palestine and the Holy See (Vatican), both of which are non-member observers of the UN. So really, there are 195 countries in the world. South Sudan was added to the list in 2011.Hey, and I m not even the president! But I do know how to Google. We re sure Barron Trump could do that for his father since he s obviously not capable of looking up important information.Featured image via video screen capture  ",News,"November 6, 2017"
 University Of Texas Police Kick Humiliated Nazis Off Campus Before They Could Start Trouble,"This is how police should deal with Nazis and white supremacists.The tiki torches were doused early at the University of Texas on Friday night after campus police quickly chased the group of racists off the premises.They were attempting to invade the campus and hold a rally on the Main Mall, which likely would have included Nazi chants and waving Confederate and Nazi flags.But police put a stop to it before the rally could even begin.After police informed the public of the service provided, university president Gregory Fenves released a statement strongly condemning white supremacy. The actions of white supremacists and other hate groups are completely anathema to UT s values, and I abhor what they represent,  Fenves said.  These are difficult times for our nation, with movements fueled by hatred increasingly taking root, as we saw in Charlottesville and elsewhere. We must continue to denounce these ugly, un-American ideas in the strongest terms. The actions of a hate group do not define us. They never will. White supremacists and Nazis have been emboldened since Donald Trump refused to condemn them in response to the violence in Charlottesville, Virginia earlier this year. Instead, Trump blamed  both sides  and claimed that a lot of Nazis are  fine people. University of Texas president Gregory Fenves said what Trump should have said in the first place.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"November 6, 2017"
 Trump Went To Japan And Immediately Proved He Knows Zilch About How Missiles Work,"Who knew that Donald Trump would humiliate himself and us as soon as humanly possible with his trip to Asia? There was really no way to know that   this is one of the smartest men on the planet oh wait. This is Donald Trump. And in discussing North Korea s decision to fire ballistic missiles over Japan, he wondered why Japan didn t just shoot those missiles down.That, in turn, shows a complete and total lack of knowledge about how missiles work, about even our own military s capabilities, and about the optics of such an endeavor on ours and Japan s part. First off, it would have been extremely difficult for Japan to shoot them down due to their altitude and speed. Japan does have missile interceptors, but North Korea s missiles were very likely out of range.Then there are the optics: Japan would have been embarrassed alongside us. Our own capabilities to shoot down missiles are also limited, and tests on both systems have failed consistently. Watching us and Japan embarrass ourselves would have emboldened North Korea because it would have told them that we can t stop their missiles. An emboldened North Korea is the last thing the world needs right now.But that s not all. Trump also insulted all of Japan by saying that he couldn t understand why a country full of samurai warriors wouldn t want to shoot down North Korea s missiles. While the samurai are a part of Japan s long and rich history, Trump calling them  a nation of samurai warriors  just reinforces the rest of the world s belief that Americans are too stupid and too arrogant to bother learning about anyone else, and would rather just fall back on ethnic stereotypes.These remarks took place well before Trump actually headed to Japan; however, the news of it came out as he was en route. So, just like every other international trip on which the walking racist presidential impostor has gone, we have been embarrassed on the world stage.

 The Walls Close In On Trump As His Disgraced National Security Adviser Faces Indictment From Team Mueller,"Donald Trump s scandal-ridden, chaotic White House has recently been thrown into further disarray as people who worked on his campaign have faced indictments from Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team. His former Campaign Chair Paul Manafort was taken into federal custody this past Monday, as was Manafort s sidekick and Trump adviser Rick Gates. Foreign policy adviser George Padadopuolos pled guilty to charges he was facing, and is now cooperating with Mueller s team. Now, NBC News is reporting that disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is under Mueller s gun as well, because there is now enough evidence to charge Flynn in this oh so hot investigation into collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government.According to NBC News, Mueller is pressuring Flynn to cooperate, because there is a person near and dear to Flynn s heart who could be in trouble: His own son, Michael G. Flynn. The younger Michael Flynn worked on the campaign and the Trump transition team. If the elder Flynn cooperates with Team Mueller, he just might be able to save his son from hard prison time. Most parents would definitely be up for limiting the legal consequences of something this serious for their children. This is very bad news for the Trump White House, because Michael Flynn was very close to Donald Trump during the campaign and worked in the White House as National Security Adviser for 24 days. He clearly knows a lot, and if it means that sharing that information would keep his son out of federal prison, he ll likely be more than willing to share that information with Special Counsel Robert Mueller s team.This is all very bad news for the Trump White House, but very good news for the country. The more people Mueller flips, the closer we are to removing this criminal administration.This is a developing story.

 Trump Wants The Supreme Court To Punish Lawyers Who Win Cases Against His Administration,"This is yet another egregious abuse of power.If the Supreme Court caves in to Donald Trump s latest demands, it will truly be the end of the rule of law as we know it.Two weeks ago, a 17-year-old migrant (known as Jane Doe in court records) sought an abortion but was denied the procedure by the Trump Administration.The government forced her to remain in a refugee center in Texas rather than allow her to exercise a constitutional right.So the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took the Trump Administration to court and asked the judge to grant their client the ability to seek the medical care she needed.To make a long story short, she won. And she won again when the Trump Administration appealed. The girl then went to a doctor and got an abortion.But, of course, this made the Trump Administration angry.Despite the fact that the girl legally received an abortion, Trump s Justice Department is throwing a temper tantrum because they think the girl should have informed them so that they could block her by appealing to a higher court. This was a total surprise. And we re disturbed about it,  disgraced Attorney General Jeff Sessions whined.Let s make this clear. The girl had the abortion following a ruling by a federal appeals court judge that granted her request to seek the procedure. She did not have to wait nor did she have to inform the government. It is the government s responsibility to file appeals quickly. But the Trump Administration did not file quick enough.And now the Trump Administration is demanding that the Supreme Court punish the ACLU lawyers for winning their case and helping their client get the abortion she wanted.According to the Tribune Washington Bureau,On Friday, new Solicitor General Noel Francisco filed an appeal that asks the Supreme Court to set aside the lower court s rulings and to consider  disciplinary action  against the ACLU.They  kept the government in the dark about when Ms. Doe was scheduled to have an abortion,  he told the justices.  Given the extraordinary circumstances  of the case, the court should consider sanctions against one or more of the ACLU lawyers, he said.Trump s Administration is stooping to a new low. The Supreme Court should not be used as a tool to punish or attack lawyers who help their clients win. The ACLU won their case twice and their client exercised her right to have an abortion in accordance with the court decision. They were not required to inform the federal government. That would have been a violation of their client s privacy. If the Trump Administration wanted to appeal, they should have done it much faster instead of expecting a teen girl and her lawyers to keep them informed about her every move.ACLU legal director David Cole reacted strongly to Trump s demand. This administration has gone to astounding lengths to block this young woman from getting an abortion. After the courts cleared the way for her to get her abortion, it was the ACLU s job as her lawyers to see that she wasn t delayed any further   not give the government another chance to stand in her way. Our lawyers acted in the best interest of our client and in full compliance with court orders and federal and Texas law. That government lawyers failed to seek judicial review quickly enough is their fault, not ours. If the conservative Justices on the Supreme Court go along with this demand, it will only further erode the credibility of the court and our justice system. And Trump would have a new weapon to use against anyone who opposes him in a court of law.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"November 4, 2017"
 Hypocrite Ivanka Trump HUMILIATED For Calling For End To Sexual Harassment While Predator Dad Is In Japan With Her,"This did NOT go well.In a nearly empty room of people on Friday at the World Assembly for Women in Japan, Ivanka Trump had the gall to talk about sexual harassment despite the fact that her own daddy has been accused of rape and sexual harassment by over a dozen women, not to mention the fact that he has openly treated women like shit over the years. All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,  Trump said.  This takes all forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated. Our workplaces must mirror our values: work and family. Here s the video via Time, which Ivanka retweeted as if her words would be taken seriously.Ivanka Trump speaks at the Tokyo Summit on Women s Advancement pic.twitter.com/64vX7wKynj  TIME (@TIME) November 3, 2017But it s hard to take anything Ivanka says on the topic of sexual harassment seriously when she has repeatedly failed to acknowledge that her own father is a sexual predator with a history of sexual harassment and a string of accusers.And Twitter users were quick to call her out for this hypocrisy.We're waiting for Ivanka to show women she's not a fraud re harassment.

" With Just Two Words, GOP Congressman ADMITS He Doesn’t Answer To His Constituents","The GOP Congress, with the approval of Donald Trump, is putting forth yet another tax bill that would take food off the tables of regular people so the wealthy can hoard even more money. You would think they would show a modicum of shame, that they would at least pretend that they are working for the voters, but this is the age of Trump and they are proud of the oligarchy they ve created. They are so proud they are literally saying, in front of reporters, that they don t care what the voters think about this wildly unpopular tax plan.Several polls have proven that tax cuts, especially tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, barely scratch the surface of Americans  concerns. It s hardly even a priority for brainwashed Republicans. Only about a quarter of Americans overall think tax reform should be a top priority, while barely half of Republicans (51 percent) think it should head the agenda.The majority of Americans have had it with the trickle down argument and they don t believe that a corporate tax cut will lead to more jobs.Some GOP selling points aren t sinking in. One of Republicans  biggest talking points is that a corporate tax cut will benefit workers (though even right-wing economists have cast doubt on White House estimates on this point).But nearly 60 percent of people believe corporations won t  use that money to create jobs,  according to the CBS poll. Likewise, approximately half of people in both the CBS and NBC/WSJ polls said they think the bill would grow the economy   a plurality but not a clear majority.Source: NPRScrew what voters think, at least that s the mindset of Republicans who know exactly who put them in office, the oligarchy. A Vox reporter confronted some GOP Congressmen about the tax bill that few people have seen and the most telling answer came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-NY), who in two words told us exactly what he thinks of his constituents  opinions:Others had answers the weren t quite as callous and were a bit more measured. They fell back on denial and Trump s  fake news  copout. I don t believe that poll,  stressed Texas Rep. Mike Conaway. I would love to see those polls, because those aren t polls of my constituents,  added Missouri Rep. Jason Smith.Golshan couldn t find a single Republican member of Congress who would acknowledge how unpopular the idea is with voters of passing a tax bill to let corporations pay even less of their fair share.Republicans need to work a little harder on their messaging of their pet tax bill. According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Republicans have a chance to pass their first major initiative since Trump took office, as long as they can get Americans to back it. So far, they are failing and their cavalier responses to Americans  concerns aren t helping. Of course, Collins might be right. As long as they have gerrymandering, voter suppression and Russia in their back pockets, voters  opinions might not actually matter.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News,"November 3, 2017"
" ‘Alt-Right’ White House Reporter Gets Fooled By Fake Tweet, Reports Upcoming Civil War","When Donald Trump allowed popular Nazi blog The Gateway Pundit to have a correspondent show up at the White House, many questioned that decision   but if The Donald was going for comic relief, we re forced to admit that the inclusion of Lucian Wintrich is a complete success.Recently, the White House reporter followed up on a hot tip he received from noted Twitter political sociologist guy Krang T. Nelson informing America that  Antifa  (a blanket term for people who oppose fascism) is breeding a team of super soldiers (yes, like in Marvel comics) which they will unleash on America in a devastating attack on white people   a first strike in a new civil war he reported on completely seriously in a now-disappeared scare piece. Can t wait for November 4th when millions of antifa supersoldiers will behead all white parents and the small business owners in the town square,  Krang tweeted   an obvious joke, unless you re a f*cking idiot.Enter Wintrich, who reported it completely seriously then threw a massive tantrum when the obviously humorous comment turned out to be fake.In addition, a bunch of right-wingers mass reported Krang s post and got him suspended from Twitter. Anyone with a single crease in their brain could see that my post was satire, but alas, the internet has no shortage of morons, and the tweet was apparently reported into oblivion,  Krang T. Nelson said of the attack in an op-ed he wrote for Vice.  The ensuing suspension was so thorough that my work account was axed for using the same phone number. (I reached out to Twitter for comment in connection with this story, but had yet to hear back at the time of publication.) It s worth noting that Donald Trump has not once been suspended from Twitter.Unfortunately, this is common fare for the Stupid Part of America. They genuinely believe that Hillary Clinton is running a child sex slavery operation out of the basement of a pizza restaurant that doesn t even have a basement, that  antifa  is going to murder white women, or even that Malia Obama got herself arrested buying six pounds of marijuana and somehow managed to fit it into a Prada handbag. But when the truth comes out they blame the people who are laughing at them instead of themselves for being so goddamn stupid.Wintrich is just the latest example that the Party of Fake News and personal responsibility produces the majority of the former and has no sense of the latter.Featured image via screengrab",News,"November 2, 2017"
 Papa John Attacks The NFL And First Amendment After His Sh*tty Pizza Loses Him A Small Fortune,"Rather than take personal responsibility for the losses, CEO John Schnatter is making excuses.NFL players, both black and white, have been taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial injustice. Conservatives lost their shit and decided to boycott the NFL. However, while viewership is slightly down, it s not enough to affect the corporate profits of businesses who are partnered with the league.But Schnatter blamed the NFL and the protests anyway after a quarterly report caused investors to dump their Papa John s stock, which caused Schnatter to lose $70 million from his personal fortune Leadership starts at the top, and this is an example of poor leadership,  Schnatter whined.  We are totally disappointed that the NFL and its leadership did not resolve the ongoing situation to the satisfaction of all parties long ago. This should have been nipped in the bud a year and a half ago. The controversy is polarizing the customer, polarizing the country. In other words, Schnatter thinks the NFL should have banned players from kneeling during the national anthem, a move that would have violated their constitutional rights.Let s not forget that NFL players were not kneeling en masse until Donald Trump, whom Schnatter supports, attacked Colin Kaepernick and the NFL in the first place. It was Trump s attacks that caused players to join the protest.So if Schnatter should blame anyone, he should blame Trump.Let s also not forget that Schnatter repeatedly attacked President Obama over the Affordable Care Act, even going so far as to raise the price of pizza and cut his employees  hours so he wouldn t have to provide health insurance to them. Papa John s has also been guilty of stealing wages.All of this caused Americans to boycott Papa John s, which could have caused the chain to lose money as well.Schnatter s claims are also full of shit because Pizza Hut executives say their sales have not been affected by the protests. We re not seeing impact on any of that on our business,  CEO Greg Creed said.Of course, Schnatter really doesn t have anything to bitch about. After all, he is still worth over $800 million and owns a sprawling 40,000 square foot castle in Kentucky, which includes a pool, a golf course, a 22 car garage, and a drawbridge along with two other homes in Florida and Utah.Schnatter is a greedy prick who should really only blame himself for the financial losses his company has suffered. And frankly, the NFL should cut ties with Papa John s in retaliation for this unfair attack. Then he ll really have something to bitch about.Featured Image: YouTube",News,"November 2, 2017"

When you saw the popular meme floating around prior to the election, you probably assumed it was an over-the-top joke post. But this is the type of this that Russian bots and trolls were actually marketing to our beloved dolts on the Right.Since conservatives respond to anything with  Jesus  in the name the meme, which was part of a paid advertising campaign from the Russia-created Christian group  Army of Jesus,  was pretty successful with the Stupid Part of America.I don't know why I am so fascinated by this fake ad that @MarkWarner shared showing Hillary boxing Jesus. pic.twitter.com/BkR8XRUOYj  Marcus Gilmer (@marcusgilmer) November 1, 2017The paid Russian ad, revealed by Democratic Senator Mark Warner, was among several that were showcased during Wednesday s congressional hearing with social media leaders regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election.Russian operatives also pushed the idea that Texas should secede from the United States, a fake movement that became popular with very real conservatives as the election season rolled on, organized both pro- and anti-Muslim events at the same time and place, and convinced conservatives that control of the Army should be taken away from the President if that President happens to have a vagina:NEW: These are the first two Russian-bought Facebook ads to be released by Congress. pic.twitter.com/1ThgzYNdTf  Donie O'Sullivan (@donie) October 31, 2017Russia ran more than 3,000 political ads on Facebook and Twitter, spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to trick the American people.Much of the advertising was concentrated in key swing states, and at one point Twitter users were bombarded with more fake news than real news.This is just one of the many attacks on our election from Donald Trump s friends in Russia.

Prior to yesterday s attack, no terrorist had used a vehicle to murder American citizens. Trump promised to keep Americans safe and he promised to wipe out ISIS. He failed.And instead of taking responsibility, Trump decided to blame the top Democrat in the Senate.But Schumer was quick to respond, and he hammered Trump with his own budget, which Republicans are poised to pass.As it turns out, Trump eliminated anti-terrorism funding in his budget and refused to put it back even after the NYPD announced that their anti-terror program would be wiped out by the cut.Schumer wasted no time pointing out Trump s hypocrisy. I have always believed and continue to believe that immigration is good for America. President Trump, instead of politicizing and dividing America, which he always seems to do at times of national tragedy, should be focusing on the real solution   anti-terrorism funding   which he proposed cutting in his most recent budget. I m calling on the President to immediately rescind his proposed cuts to this vital anti-terrorism funding. Basically, Trump would be inviting terrorists to attack the United States by cutting anti-terrorism funding. So instead of worrying about our immigration policies, Americans should be angry about Trump s irresponsible decision to cut funding that helps law enforcement keep us safe.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"November 1, 2017"
 This 2016 Hannity Tweet Is Now Like A Knife In The Back For Trump,"No one on earth has been a bigger cheerleader for Donald Trump than Fox News  Sean Hannity. In the wake of Monday s indictments of former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, Manafort s top aide Rick Gates and with a guilty plea of former economic advisor to Trump, George Papadopoulos, it appears the house of cards is beginning to collapse.Hannity, though, is ready with the pro-Trump propaganda. Immediately after the news of the indictment hit, Hannity was ready with his defense of Trump which means he s blaming Hillary:Not that there wasn t Russian collusion with a 2016 presidential candidate. It s just that her name was not Trump. We now have real evidence that the FBI uncovered a Russian plot dating back to 2009 that involved bribery, extortion, blackmail, money laundering and racketeering. It all came a year before Hillary Clinton and the Obama Administration approved the corrupt Uranium One deal. We have evidence of another Russia scandal, also involving a 2016 candidate not named Trump. We now know that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee paid over $9 million to help fund the discredited, Russia-linked dossier crafted to ruin then-candidate Donald Trump. This was nothing short of a collaborative effort with the Russians to manipulate the outcome of the last presidential election.Not surprisingly, Trump s statements are mirroring Hannity:Sorry, but this is years ago, before Paul Manafort was part of the Trump campaign. But why aren't Crooked Hillary & the Dems the focus?????  Donald J.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders spent her entire Monday briefing lying through her teeth with regards to the Manfort and Gates situation. As if this weren t bad enough for Team Trump, a third person in their orbit has been charged as well, foreign policy adviser George Padadopoulos. It also seems that this gentleman may be flipping on Trump, because he was caught lying to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is a crime, and is being listed as a cooperating witness, according to former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara:Special Counsel Mueller appears to have a cooperating witness, George Papadopoulos. That is significant. Time will tell how significant.  Preet Bharara (@PreetBharara) October 30, 2017In short, the entire Trump White House is in deep shit. Sarah Sanders can say all day long that this has nothing to do with Trump s campaign, and they had to go flipping it all back to Hillary, even though she is a private citizen:These people are unbelievable. All I know is that this will continue to get closer to Trump and his inner circle, and they ll be removed in due course. Hopefully, the snakes in that pit continue to turn on each other in order to save their own skins, and we can take our country back from these treasonous squatters.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"October 30, 2017"
 This Is What Fox News Considered ‘News’ As Everyone Else Covered Indictment Of Trump Camp Manager,"This morning, Trump s former campaign manager was indicted for conspiracy against the United States, a.k.a. treason (among other things   you can read the full list of charges here), and ordered to turn himself in to the FBI. As he did so, every news outlet was busy covering it, reporting on the situation as it developed. Except for Fox News. They must have needed some time to decide on their spin because they were reporting on candy and hamburger emojis while the story on Paul Manafort unfolded.Seriously. They were reporting on Halloween candy and some kind of  hamburger emoji crisis  at Google as the first indictment in Robert Mueller s Russia investigation was unsealed and handed down.8:30AM: CNN, Bloomberg, MSNBC, Fox pic.twitter.com/zfbo4PriSo  Rogue CPI (@RogueCPI) October 30, 2017As of 8:41, Fox has moved on to real issues. pic.twitter.com/DwGqgthW5R  Rae Whitlock (@RaeWhitlock) October 30, 2017This is FOX News currently  pic.twitter.com/4yInN7exr5  Josh S nchez (@jnsanchez) October 30, 2017CNN: Paul Manafort to turn himself in to FBI today MSNBC: Manfort Told to Surrender Fox News: Important story on hamburger emojis ???  pic.twitter.com/AQ8GxpAh8N  StrictlyCovfef  ?

He is, of course, calling the whole thing a conspiracy in which Mueller comes up completely empty on the collusion story.Har de har har. Manafort is a slimeball. Unless Trump has something serious on him (and what could be more serious than the charges already against him?), Manafort will probably place his own ass above Trump s.Featured image via Frederick M.

 Attempts By Trump To Pardon Anyone Indicted By Mueller Could Backfire On Him In A BIG Way,"There s a lot of talk that, if Mueller indicts friends and associates of Trump over the Russia scandal, Trump will just pardon them and nobody will get punished, least of all Trump. There are two problems with that: First, to accept a pardon is to admit guilt, so he d be throwing them under the bus. But secondly, and perhaps more importantly, any pardons he issues could land him in hot water just that much sooner. According to Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), his pardoning power is not exactly absolute.Schiff told ABC News: I don t think the president s power is all that absolute, as people have been suggesting.The president cannot pardon people if it s an effort to obstruct justice, if it s an effort to prevent Bob Mueller and others from learning about the President s own conduct. So, there are limitations. This whole thing really took off when Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate whether Trump obstructed justice when he fired James Comey. It s true that the Constitution does give the president broad power to issue pardons for  offenses against the United States.  However, we currently don t have any precedent for a president pardoning people tied to his own campaign, and rumors have been circulating that Trump wants to test his pardoning powers to see just how far they actually go.That could be part of why the Tweeter-In-Chief was panicking so badly on Twitter that he screamed,  DO SOMETHING!  in a rant about Hillary Clinton and Uranium One. He might be aware that not only is Mueller getting closer to something that implicates him, which we just can t have, but also that he can t pardon anyone Mueller indicts (or perhaps has been strongly warned away from trying).A pardon would require an admission of guilt, but it would also prevent people from flipping on Trump and singing out the truth in exchange for lesser charges or a lesser sentence. Depending on who s indicted, and what they do, the man who would be king in the White House will find it far more difficult to keep claiming that Russia is just a distraction and there s nothing to it.And so will all his lackeys.Too bad.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"October 29, 2017"
 Here’s What We ALL Need To Do If Trump Moves To Fire Mueller And Shut Down The Russia Probe,"Now that Special Counsel Robert Mueller is about to indict someone from Team Trump, The Donald and his cronies are panicking. They are realizing that the Russia probe is reaching all the way to the top levels of Trump World, and it might touch Trump s kids   or even Trump himself. Therefore, it shouldn t be a surprise if Trump moves to fire Robert Mueller in an effort to shut this probe down before more indictments start coming down. However, thanks to the good people over at MoveOn.org, there is a nationwide plan in place to respond to a Mueller firing within hours. Here is an image, via Twitter, of what that page looks like. You can even search by your zip code.This! pic.twitter.com/Pd36aLTTVX  WonderWoman (@AspenGold_) October 28, 2017Trump and his swamp creatures may believe that they are above the law. They are not. Nobody   not even and perhaps ESPECIALLY not the president   is above legal ramifications for operating in an unlawful fashion. These people are treasonous, and Robert Mueller is going to prove it. If Mueller is removed, we might as well hand the United States of America over to Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin.America, we must be the guardians of our own democratic republic. These incompetent authoritarians are destroying this country with their treasonous ways, and the only way to rid the nation of the scourge of white supremacy, homophobia, misogyny, xenophobia, and all other forms of dangerous bigotry and autocracy operating at the highest levels of our government is to remove and jail them all. Robert Mueller is key to that. He could save us   so if Trump tries to fire Mueller, it is up to refuse to let that stand.Featured image via Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images",News,"October 29, 2017"

It s not a pretty picture for Donald Trump.Premiums were always going to go up   that s what you get with the system we have and one major reason we need universal or single-payer coverage.

And Charles isn t the only one coming up with horrific numbers, either. The Kaiser Family Foundation has done their own analysis and come up with some pretty damning numbers as well.The worst part is that the markets were starting to stabilize going into this year, which meant premium hikes would likely have slowed for next year, and maybe even started coming down in following years. Instead, they re now skyrocketing. Polls have also consistently shown growing support for fixing the ACA instead of repealing it. What Trump and his party did was a planned and deliberate political move to harm Obama s legacy without caring who else they hurt.These extreme premium hikes are on Trump s and the GOP s heads.

 ‘DO SOMETHING!’: Trump Panics As Mueller’s Investigation Closes In On Him,"With news circulating that Robert Mueller will be handing down his first indictment in the Russia investigation soon, Donald Trump is allowing us to watch him squirm in Twitterland.As usual, Trump demanded that everyone stop looking at him and instead focus on his eternal scapegoat, Hillary Clinton and the phone right-wing  uranium  conspiracy.

 Hillary Clinton TOTALLY Just Rubbed ‘Indictment’ Rumors In Trump’s Big Orange Face (SCREENSHOTS),"Former First Lady Hillary Clinton doesn t tweet nearly as often as current national embarrassment Donald Trump, but hers are far more entertaining than The Donald s.With news circulating that the first of probably many indictments in the Russia investigation is being handed down Monday, Clinton seized upon the opportunity to point out that it was the anniversary of the  Comey letter,  which  was probably decisive  in placing our tiny-handed orange dotard in the office in the first place according to FiveThirtyEight  editor-in-chief Nate Silver. Oh is that today?  Clinton said, linking Silver s tweet.The article Silver links notes that the letter Comey sent to Congress telling them the FBI had learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation  into Clinton s private email server,  upended the news cycle and soon halved Clinton s lead in the polls, imperiling her position in the Electoral College. Republicans and the majority of the media shoved the letter in the American people s faces seemingly non-stop, sticking us with the useless egomaniacal danger to our country who, unlike his predecessor, is embroiled in a legitimate scandal that actually threatens the future of our nation, that we know and hate today.It s good to see that Clinton was able to keep her sense of humor through all of this. It s a good reminder to all of us that we need to occasionally step back and have a laugh at the almost unbelievably stupid situation we ve found ourselves in.Featured image via  Getty Images",News,"October 28, 2017"
 Judge Who Barred A Mom From Seeing Her Baby For A Year Over Unpaid Fees Resigns,"With all the recent talk of sentencing reform and unfair bail across America, sometimes what it takes is an outrageous case in a small town somewhere to light a fire under activists to demand a change. And even though the resignation of a judge in Pearl, Mississippi, a suburb of the capital with a meager 25,000 residents, isn t really anyone s idea of a revolution, it probably means a lot to the mother at the center of the case.Judge John Shirley of the now-dissolved Pearl Youth Court decided back in August of 2016 that some unpaid court fees were enough to separate  Mother A,  a resident of nearby Jackson, from her baby for a period of 14 months. The unidentified mom and a friend were driving through Pearl one day looking for work when they were pulled over by a police officer who discovered that both women had misdemeanor warrants for minor offenses.Honestly, the story begins with that officer, who is also unidentified in the report from the Clarion-Ledger, the news outlet that first reported the judge s resignation. So much begins with a cop s interaction with a young person   will they detain them? Will they give them a warning? Initial contact with law enforcement often determines the course of a young person s life, and most police are totally aware of that fact. Mother A  had her baby with her that day, and although the woman s grandmother came to the scene immediately to collect the baby, that officer decided to change the young woman s life by requiring her to bring the child before the Pearl Youth Court.If it seems like I m being too hard on the cop, let me assure you, I ve saved most of my hate for Judge Shirley. How an arbiter of justice thinks ordering a young mother to stay away from her newborn baby is anything approaching justice is bewildering to me. But that s just what Judge Shirley did, remanding the infant to the custody of the grandmother and imposing a goddamn NO CONTACT ORDER between Mother A and her baby until the poor (as in, without money) young woman could pay off her court fees.Not only could she not see her child, she couldn t see her grandmother while the baby was present. It was just to be cruel. That s the only explanation.Cliff Johnson, the Director of the Roderick and Solange MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Mississippi School of Law, agreed. As a civil rights lawyer in Mississippi, I am no stranger to injustice, but for a judge to prohibit an impoverished mother from having any contact with her baby until monetary payments are made is shocking and repugnant. Such orders are tantamount to judicial kidnapping. Between two people   one cop and one judge   a young woman s life is forever changed, her idea of justice forever skewed, her trust in authority forever hobbled by the fear of a cruelty that exists only for its own sake.Featured image via judgejohnshirley.com",News,"October 27, 2017"
 John Lewis Has the PERFECT Birthday Message For Hillary And Trump Will Be FURIOUS (TWEET),"Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) is a civil rights icon. He took beatings in the infamous Bloody Sunday massacre in Selma, Alabama at the height of the Civil Rights Movement. Of course, after Donald Trump was elected, Rep. Lewis, like all sane people, was horrified, and questioned his legitimacy. This led Trump to strike out in his usual petty   and in this case, racist   fashion, and the two have been on the outs ever since. Therefore, What John Lewis had to say to Hillary Clinton for her birthday on Twitter is sure to reignite the feud. Rep. Lewis simply tweeted:Happy Birthday, Madame President @HillaryClinton  John Lewis (@repjohnlewis) October 26, 2017Of course, the Russians helped elect Trump, and Hillary won the popular vote by more than three million people. Further, Trump is clearly unfit for the office he is currently squatting in, and he is destroying our democracy as we speak. The Electors should have refused to certify his election, and the Electoral College should have functioned as the Founders intended. Further, the American public elected Hillary Clinton, a quirk that allowed a few counties in a few states to flip the electoral votes   along with the Russians   elected Trump. He is illegitimate. So, to that end, hats off, Rep. Lewis, and to our beloved Hillary Clinton   Happy birthday, Madame President!Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2017"
 Milo Yiannopoulos Tells Aussies To Vote Against Marriage Equality Weeks After His Own Gay Wedding,"Milo Yiannopoulos will do anything to keep his name in the spotlight after his shameful resignation from his position as senior editor for Breitbart News back in February and now the homosexual far-right media troll has a new avenue   Trying to convince Australians to vote against marriage equality, despite marrying an unnamed man in a private ceremony in Hawaii just weeks ago.Australians are currently being asked by their federal government to take part in a postal vote to decide whether the law should be changed to allow same-sex couples to marry, as the law in Australia was altered in 2004 to define marriage as between a man and a woman. Surveys were sent out to Australians aged over 18 years of age and enrolled on the Commonwealth Electoral Role, with results of the mail-in only poll scheduled to be announced on November 15.The vote, coming at a cost of AU$122 million (US$94 million), has stirred up more than its fair share of controversy, with the nation divided over whether to vote  yes  or  no.  Surprisingly, Yiannopoulos has become a rather loud proponent for Australians to vote against same-sex marriage, just weeks after his own gay marriage. My gut would be to vote against it, Yiannopoulos told the Daily Mail, adding  I m gay and a Catholic. The highest priority for me is making sure no church, no believer anywhere, is required to violate their religious conscience. I think those things can co-exist perfectly peacefully. I think the state probably should recognize a gay couple who want to commit to one another,  He continued.  But the paramount consideration is not those gay couples   it is religious freedoms. Another fear that Yiannopoulos has is the effect same-sex marriage could have on gay culture.  One of the few advantages of being gay was that you could tumble out of a nightclub at 1am on a Tuesday and no one could have a go at you for it. But if we re buying into these institutions like marriage, I worry that there will be a deadening effect on gay culture. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but comments like these are more than just a little ironic when they come directly from the mouth of a man who recently had his own gay marriage. Photos surfaced of Yiannopoulos  marriage ceremony in Hualalai, Hawaii late last month, with his spouse named on Wikipedia as  John,  although little else is known.Yiannopoulos resigned from Breitbart in February of this year amid a cloud of controversy after a video emerged where he stated that the relationship between a man or woman and 13-year-old boys can be  perfectly consensual  and a positive experience for the boys.Featured image via Stephanie Keith/Getty Images",News,"October 26, 2017"
" Alt-Right Trump Lover Loses His Sh*t, Kills His Own Dad For Calling Him A Nazi","You might never suspect that up here in beautiful Washington State, we have one of the largest numbers of white supremacist groups in America. After all, it s gorgeous and relatively quiet, and this is a  blue  state, right? But under all of our fall colors, our lakes, our bike lanes, and our farmer s markets is the same hate you see in the Deep South or the rural Midwest or really anywhere in the United States.In fact, here in the northwest part of the Northwest, there are a surprising number of  Alt-Right  adherents. But considering how rural much of the area between Seattle and Canada is, nobody should be surprised at how many Trump supporters there are. And that seems to have been the catalyst for many people in my neck of the woods who at one time were relatively self-policing: Permission from the president to be bigots. If you listen to Donald Trump when the conversation moves to white nationalism, the subtext is almost that bigotry makes you more American, and we have got some flag wavers in these parts.So last month when my local paper covered a local murder that was, at least peripherally, connected to the Alt-Right, it really wasn t shocking to me. My (now-adult) son and I have attended any number of rallies up and down the freeway corridor we live on, and there is a strong presence of Richard Spencer wannabes and Milo Yiannopoulos sycophants at every single one. But over the fold was a face I knew: Lane Davis, a 33-year-old guy who lived a few doors down from my mom s old house. I saw him in stores and on the street. I bummed him a smoke outside the Safeway more than once.I touched that guy s hand.Image via FacebookHe killed his dad out on Samish Island, an island that s only actually an island because of a river that crosses the farmland you have have to drive through to get out there. You don t think about white supremacists on your way to Samish Island. I didn t anyway. I thought about my niece s wedding and my grandpa s funeral, both held at the Samish Island Community Center. I think about the herons and red-tailed hawks that hang out in those fields. I think about my mom sometimes. She s a Trump supporter and a bigot, but she wouldn t stab anyone like Lane Davis did.Davis worked for Milo for a little while, and he went by the online name  Seattle4Truth,  under which he posted to Reddit, his YouTube channel, and later, a super-mega-extremely-far-right website,  The Ralph Retort  (which I just won t link, so get to googling if that s your thing). And really, the link at the beginning of the last paragraph has a pretty in-depth profile of his various exploits, after The Daily Beast got their hands on the 911 call his mother made that fateful day.But it s incomplete. This is a small place, and it s personal. The judge who signed off on Davis  probable cause affidavit was the same man who gave me custody of my son. My friends are friends with Lane Davis  friends. I guarantee without texting her to ask her that the saleswoman who used to sell furniture for me knew Lane Davis personally and had possibly been to his house. When I tell you about the little place I live in, and how I casually handed out smokes to an eventual murderer, and the geography and wildlife near where that murderer lived, what I want you to do is go back to the words in bold letters a few paragraphs ago.Before Donald Trump, the white nationalists, racists, skinheads, Klan members, and just generally hateful people around here might have said something racist in public once. Maybe they had  No Trespassing  signs all over their deep-woods properties 20 miles up the Skagit River. Maybe they sported  III%  or  Prius Repellent  stickers on their giant trucks with the smokestacks tuned to blast creosote every time they leave a stoplight.Now they kill their dad because he called them a Nazi and tried to kick them out of the house when he got sick of their bullshit.Heck, Lane Davis isn t even the first murderer I ve ever known. I used to play D&D when I was a kid with a dude who killed another guy after a party back in the early 90 s. But that guy, by the time we were teens, we knew he was going to end up in prison. He was disturbed. He was morbid. He was violent.Lane Davis was just a racist until Donald Trump came along.Featured image via screen capture",News,"October 25, 2017"
 WATCH: This Amazingly Aware Company Has Created A Brilliant Way To Document Trump’s Dangerous Tweets,"Donald Trump s Twitter habit is dangerous. When one has the bully pulpit of the White House to speak from, words definitely matter. That s why it s so concerning when Trump threatens nuclear war in 140 characters or less   it s because he could actually carry it out in a matter of minutes, and the whole world knows this   and is terrified he d do it just for kicks. The same is true   albeit to a lesser degree   when Trump cozies  up to dictators like Kim Jung-un and Vladimir Putin, while insulting our allies, like his insulting phone call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Of course, these are just a few examples, as Trump spends more time tweeting than he does doing anything else.Since Trump s tweets become more alarming by the day and are far too numerous to constantly keep up with, an awesome company has found a way to help do it   and it s super rad. The good folks at Parse/Error have created the  Political Lamp,  which is an entertaining piece of decor that lights up in a lightening storm with every Trump tweet. They say they like to be politically aware, and decided that Trump s Twitter feed is important to document because of what the orange fascist represents: He perfectly embodies a dangerous era. A world where the words of one man   can endanger the fate of millions by spreading the ghost of nuclear war on the planet. Parse/Error is correct. These are dangerous times. The GOP-controlled Congress might be worrying over tax cuts because they are craven cowards who are terrified of Trump lighting them up on Twitter, but they d better serve the nation and the world   as well as their own places in history   by doing all they can to rid the world of the threat of Trump before he kills us all.In the meantime, though, this lamp is amazing, and everyone should have one!

 Soldier’s Widow Finally Speaks: ‘It Made Me Cry Even More’ — Trump Calls Her A Liar IMMEDIATELY,"Monday morning, things got much worse for Donald Trump and his version of what happened during the phone call he made to Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in the Nigerian ambush orchestrated by ISIS.Appearing on ABC s Good Morning America, the grieving widow confirmed the account of the Florida Representative, Frederica Wilson, who was accompanying her on her way to meet her husband s remains when Trump s call came in. Not only did she repeat exactly what Wilson had recalled, but she said it made her  very upset and hurt,  and made her cry  even worse  on what must have been the worst day of her young life.She said that she has  nothing to say  to President Trump.Johnson was sucked into a bitter, public dispute over the call when Wilson recounted what Trump had said as she listened on speakerphone. The timeline of events just spirals from there, with Trump, his spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and his Chief of Staff retired 4-Star General John F. Kelly all taking swipes at Representative Wilson in lieu of overtly calling Myeshia Johnson herself a liar.All of that changed Monday morning.After Mrs. Johnson s appearance on GMA, Trump went back to Twitter one more time. It is now impossible to view what he s saying as anything other than calling her a liar directly.I had a very respectful conversation with the widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, and spoke his name from beginning, without hesitation!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 23, 2017The  spoke his name  part of the tweet refers to something very specific that Johnson said in the GMA interview   that the President could not remember Sgt. Johnson s name:""[Pres. Trump] couldn't remember my husband's name.   That's what hurt me the most.""   Myeshia Johnson, widow of Sgt. La David Johnson pic.twitter.com/px5io2RbJB  Good Morning America (@GMA) October 23, 2017It seems bizarre at this point that Donald Trump would continue to  defend  himself over his statements, but it s important to remember that the details of this terrorist ambush are still very, very unclear. If the whole affair turns out to be something akin to Benghazi   the attack that killed four Americans in 2012   then public perception will play a big role in who the American public blames for every aspect what happened, including how he handled the deaths.Trump seems pretty eager to shift that blame off himself and onto literally anyone else.Even the widow of a dead soldier.Watch Myeshia Johnson s interview here:Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 23, 2017"
 Nursing Textbooks Recalled And Apology Issued For Racial Stereotypes Related To Pain Management,"Pearson, an educational publishing company, issued an apology on Thursday in regards to culturally insensitive material published in their textbook Nursing: A Concept-Based Approach to Learning. The section in question was titled  Focus on Diversity and Culture: Cultural Differences in Response to Pain  and contained theories on how to treat patients from different racial and religious backgrounds in regard to their ability and willingness to tolerate pain,The segment catagorized patients, or  clients  as they are referred to in the textbook, into six groups;  Arabs/Muslims , Asians ,  Blacks ,  Jews ,  Hispanics , and  Native Americans.  If the categories weren t cringe-worthy enough, it then gave the reader tips on how a  client s culture influences their response to and beliefs about pain.  Or, in other words, racial stereotypes. Among the shameless theories included in the piece were that  Blacks  will  often report higher pain intensity than other cultures  and that  Jews  can be  more vocal and demanding of assistance,  not a particularly scientific approach when the patient s feedback is the only way of evaluating and treating their suffering. Furthermore, if there were any truth to these allegations, which there is not, the textbook s approach would still be flawed, as many patients would fit into multiple categories, such as people from predominately Muslim countries in Asia.The material came to light after a Facebook user by the name of Onyx Moore posted a photo of the page in question and outrage ensued:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));CN: Racism across the boardThis is an excellent example of how not to be even remotely culturally sensitive. These Posted by Onyx Moore on Monday, October 16, 2017In response to the attention and overall negative feedback Ms. Moore s Facebook post received,  Scott Overland, Pearson s communications director issued the following statement on Thursday: While differences in cultural attitudes towards pain are an important topic in medical programs, we presented this information in an inappropriate manner. We apologize for the offense this has caused and we have removed the material in question from current versions of the book, electronic versions of the book and future editions of this text. In addition, we now are actively reviewing all of our nursing curriculum products to identify and remove any remaining instances of this inappropriate content that might appear in other titles. We will continue to provide updates on our progress. This material does not reflect our values as a company and how we want to serve students. We always welcome feedback and we appreciate the concern shown by the students who raised this issue. The company also stated that they will recall all books with this particular segment printed in them, but as to how the material was published to begin with, Mr. Overland was less than certain.  We are working with our editorial teams as we speak to determine that,  he added.Featured image via Facebook",News,"October 23, 2017"
 Trump SCREAMS On Twitter After Seeing A Poll On Fox News,"Rex Tillerson was right. Donald Trump is a f*cking moron.After years of slamming polls as  fake,  Trump had the nerve to tout a poll on Sunday morning after Fox & Friends reported on it.The POLITICO/Morning Consult poll results show that 46 percent of respondents think the media fabricates stories about Trump.So, of course, the poll sent Trump to Twitter so he could literally scream about it and claim that his constant labeling of news outlets as  fake news  are  sinking through It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 22, 2017Let s all keep in mind that this is ONE poll. Furthermore, the results were largely split down partisan lines, with 76 percent of Republicans believing that the news media make up stories about Trump. That number rises to 85 percent among Trump s most ardent supporters.If this poll had the opposite results, Trump would be dismissing it as a fake. And we all know it.Trump only thinks news stories and polls are accurate when they kiss his ass. That s why Fox & Friends is watched by Trump on a daily basis. They not only kiss his ass, they practically give him a blow-job every morning.Back in July, a PPP poll showed that a majority of Americans trust the news media more than they trust Trump.Over 50 percent of Americans said they trust NBC, CNN, ABC, the New York Times, and The Washington Post more than they trust Trump. The percentage of people who said they trust Trump more only hovered in the mid-30s.You know what else currently stands in the mid-30s? Trump s approval rating. The latest Gallup poll shows that only 35 percent of Americans approve of Trump s job performance. The Politico poll has it at 44 percent, so you can probably guess which poll Trump will call  fake.

 Trump And John Kelly Just Got RIPPED APART By A Medal Of Honor Recipient (VIDEO),"Donald Trump and his disgraceful team deserve to be throttled for their horrendous responses and disrespect to Gold Star families, particularly after Rep. Fredericka Wilson called Trump out on his insensitive remarks to the widow of a fallen soldier.After both Trump and his Chief of Staff, John Kelly, attacked Wilson and lied their a**es off to clear Trump s name, MSNBC anchor Joy Reid brought on a guest that would make Trump sorry he ever challenged Wilson. Noting that Wilson was currently at the funeral of fallen soldier La David Johnson while Trump was playing golf, Reid said: She is at that funeral as we speak. While General Kelly and his boss, Donald Trump, are still standing by their attacks on her. Like I said, extraordinary. Then, she turned to one of her guests, retired Colonel Jack Jacobs, and asked: Donald Trump likes to hide behind his generals, he likes to push them out front in order to give himself credibility. What do you make of General Kelly s willingness to be used in that way this week and then to add this extraneous story that turns up not even to be true slamming the congresswoman? It was as if Jacobs, a Medal of Honor recipient, had been waiting all day for the opportunity to rip Trump and Kelly apart. He said: Well, it s quite surprising because I know   I don t know him very well, I m not that close to him   but I know General Kelly I m quite surprised. Attacks like this don t make any sense from anybody. The retired colonel, who is also the recipient of two Silver Stars, three Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts, also stated that Trump and Kelly owed Wilson an apology: If it were I, I would. I mean, I d pick up the phone and say,  look, this has gone far enough, I apologize.  But that should have been the case from the very beginning when whatever is emanating from the White House was inaccurate as well. And the trashing continued with this brilliant attack: I can say this about Donald Trump, he s not real good at talking. If I were Trump, I would have picked up the phone and said,  look, that was my ham-handed way of being sympathetic, I m not good at that and I apologize.  And all this stuff would have been over. Another guest, a former combat veteran, agreed with Jacobs, while Reid reminded everyone that  It s not going to stop because Donald Trump this morning, got up bright and early and starting tweeting again attacking Congresswoman Wilson. So Donald Trump doesn t want it to end and he doesn t want the discussion to be about the fact it took him 13 days to call the families of these four fallen soldiers. He wants it to be about Congresswoman Wilson. Here s that tweet:As usual, Trump just makes things worse for himself. Jacobs was dead on when he stated that Trump could have easily ended this whole debacle by apologizing for his disgusting response and all the lies. But because he s Trump, we all knew that wasn t going to happen. Trump has gotten himself into this mess, and now he must pay the price.You can watch Jacobs crush Trump below: Featured image is a screenshot",News,"October 21, 2017"
 NRA Releases Fascist Ad Calling All Trump Critics ‘Saboteurs’ Whose Future Is ‘Failure’ (VIDEO),"The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that we have the right to speak our minds about the government and anyone and anything else we damn well please. However, since Donald Trump was inaugurated, that right has been under attack. Trump is a thin-skinned, narcissistic bully who cannot take criticism, and his allies are now doing all they can to discredit anyone who dares to say a word against Trump. Of course, at the top of that list is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the terrorist organization that thinks that all these mass shootings and gun-related deaths are just the price of freedom.Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the organization, has just released a new advertisement video that can only be described as purely fascist. She attacks anyone and everyone who dares to criticize Trump as saboteurs who wish to take the victory of Trump and his base away. You see, to these people, those who do not support Trump are the REAL threat to the republic, not Trump s fascist, authoritarian regime. Loesch s statement culminates in the following chilling statement: From the highest levels of government, to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us. So, educational institutions, the free press, anyone and everyone who sees the dangers of Trumpism   we must be dealt with. It comes complete with violent imagery and creepy music to boot. This is what fascism looks like, folks. Trump is turning America into North Korea before our very eyes. We better wake up and get him out of office before he declares martial law. We are witnesses to the most ruthless attack on a president & the people who voted for him in American history.""  @DLoesch #NRA pic.twitter.com/rcPAKMVJI0  NRATV (@NRATV) October 20, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"October 21, 2017"
 WATCH: Reporters DRAG Sarah Huckabee Sanders In Brilliant Fact-Check (VIDEO),"Donald Trump is having a hard time recovering from his fallen soldier debacle, not only because he continues to make it worse, but because America is tired of his nonsense and demands the truth.It was only yesterday that White House Chief of Staff John Kelly infuriated everyone by criticizing Rep. Frederica Wilson for calling Trump out for disrespecting a Gold Star widow. Kelly also went after Wilson for an old speech in 2015, stating that she d bragged about how she had gotten money for the FBI acknowledging two deceased agents. Little did Kelly know, this lie would ignite a sh*tstorm for the Trump administration.Earlier today, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was the unfortunate recipient of the media s frustration with the dishonest Trump administration. Reporters blasted Sanders with questions in the press briefing, directly pointing out that Wilson s FBI speech completely contradicted Kelly s claims. When a reporter boldly pointed out that Wilson had never boasted about funding in her speech, Sanders stumbled through her response: Absolutely, General Kelly was stunned that Representative Wilson made comments at a building dedication honoring slain FBI agents about her own actions in Congress, including lobbying former President Obama on legislation. As he pointed out, if you re able to make a sacred act like honoring American heroes all about yourself, you re an empty barrel. Or as we say in the South, all hat, no cattle. This was hardly the end for Sanders. Because she d defended Kelly despite being faced with facts that challenged his claims, reporters attacked her and asked if she d even seen the speech. Sanders claimed she had, and a reporter pointed out that she should know that Wilson actually praised the FBI agents and didn t talk about funding. Even as her spot was completely blown up, Sanders pathetically defended Kelly.The icing on the cake was when a reporter asked if Kelly would respond to more questions over the matter. When Sanders said he already had yesterday, the reporter pointed out: He was wrong yesterday! As usual, the Trump administration responded with intimidation and bullying. Sanders fired back: If you want to go after General Kelly, that s up to you. If you want to get into a debate with the four-star Marine general, I think that s something highly inappropriate. Go ahead. You can watch Sanders get grilled by reporters below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"October 20, 2017"
 Swastika-Covered Guy Gets Punched In The Face Outside Nazi Rally And It’s Beautiful (VIDEO),"One Nazi made the mistake of leaving his  safe space  at a rally featuring infamous Nazi Richard Spencer and learned, like Spencer did at Donald Trump s inauguration, that most Americans hate his kind and just want to punch him in the face.Punching Nazis has been a controversial issue among liberals, with some saying we should hug it out with them and it will magically erase the hate and the rest of us agreeing with our family members who fought in World War II that if you see a Nazi you should probably punch him (my grandfather didn t leave most of his hip in Europe so I could hug Nazis back home, for instance)   and while some members of a crowd of protesters worked to escort the Nazi to safety, at least one person did the right thing and punched him in the f*cking mouth.The self-defense strike (no violence against a Nazi can be rightfully considered an attack) occurred at a rally in Gainesville, Florida when a man wearing a t-shirt covered in swastikas tried to walk past a group of anti-racism demonstrators. Leave him go,  a well-meaning but delusional protester can be heard shouting in video of the incident as others provide protection to the Nazi, who can be seen wearing a smug expression on his face. One of his escorts even had his arm around him like they were the best of pals:First scuffle. This man with swastikas on his shirt was surrounded by protestors. Some tried to talk to him, then he got hit. #SpenceratUF pic.twitter.com/V0B6smizAo  Kathryn Varn (@kathrynvarn) October 19, 2017Unfortunately for him, people these days aren t that great at listening to each other   so he got decked in the mouth.Protesters are punching, spitting at this man who has swastikas on his shirt. #spenceratUF pic.twitter.com/SuK0xFfixY  Michael Williams (@michaeldamianw) October 19, 2017Unfortunately, Nazis are winning the PR battle as of late in that they have convinced some liberals that we should act to protect them despite them being very vocal that they want us dead (especially if our skin tone is darker than a piece of classroom chalk).Always punch Nazis.

" Trump Brags he Owns An ‘Original Renoir’, Yet The Real Painting Is Hanging In A Chicago Gallery","By now it s common knowledge that Donald Trump believes that anything that contradicts him is  fake,  but when it comes to a battle between a Chicago art gallery and the current President of the United States as to who owns the authentic painting of Two Sisters (on the Terrace) by the French Impressionist painter Pierre-Auguste Renoir, most would believe the original is hanging in the gallery, not the President s New York penthouse. Trump begs to differ.Two Sister, Pierre Auguste #Renoir #TwitArt #ArtLovers pic.twitter.com/dTKnNNbDly  Profesor Higgins (@HigginsProfesor) August 1, 2017Donald Trump s biographer, Tim O Brien, said recently in an interview that he first spotted the painting back in 2005 on Trump s private jet and decided to question him about it.  You know, that s an original Renoir,  O Brien said Trump told him. Donald, it s not,  was O Brien s reply.  I grew up in Chicago, that Renoir is called  Two Sisters on the Terrace , and it s hanging on a wall at the Art Institute of Chicago. That s not an original.  However, in his typical style, Trump repeated the very same claim the following day.Amanda Hicks, a spokeswoman for the Art Institute of Chicago, is also convinced that the gallery is in possession of the real deal, claiming that the painting was given to the Institute as a gift back in 1933 by Annie Swan Coburn. Coburn initially bought the painting for $100,000 from an art dealer by the name of Paul Durand-Ruel, who had purchased the piece directly from Renoir himself. Hicks added that the institute is satisfied that our version is real. The painting was visible in the background during an interview with 60 Minutes that was given in the President s penthouse suite in Trump Tower soon after his election victory among others, but more than just a handful of people are questioning the piece s authenticity. The painting has long been known and has, since its gift to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1933, been one of the treasures of the museum,  said Richard Brettell, chair of aesthetic studies at the University of Texas. Can President Trump own another version? From my trained eye looking at a pretty good photograph of Mrs. Trump in their penthouse at Trump Tower, it seems clearly to be a copy of that famous Chicago picture. Richard Rand, associate director for collections at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, California, whole-heartedly agrees.  While on rare occasions Renoir made variants of his painted compositions, he never copied himself or made precise duplicates of his oil paintings,  he said in an email.  If I were presented with a picture that was an exact copy of a famous Renoir hanging in a museum, I would guess it was probably a reproduction of some kind. But do any of these facts or expert opinions bother President Trump? His biographer doesn t think so. I m sure he s still telling people who come into the apartment,  It s an original, it s an original ,  Mr O Brien said. He believes his own lies in a way that lasts for decades. He ll tell the same stories time and time again, regardless of whether or not facts are right in front of his face. Featured image via Screenshot",News,"October 20, 2017"
 WATCH: George W. Bush Calls Out Trump For Supporting White Supremacy,"Former President George W. Bush gave a speech on Thursday in which he said that  bigotry seems emboldened  in the U.S. and warned that Americans need to reject  white supremacy.  This is the speech that Trump should have given even before the Nazi march in Charlottesville. Donald Trump was backed by every white supremacist group across the board during his divisive campaign. Although Bush pointed to the  governing class,  he did not mention the former reality show star s name, but it was obvious that he was talking about Trump, his policies, and his base.Bush spoke of our  discourse being degraded by casual cruelty.  He continued to say that we ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism  and added that  we need to recover and recall our own identity. Discontent deepened and sharpened partisan conflicts  in recent years, Bush said in remarks from New York City at a forum focused on security and sponsored by the George W. Bush Institute. Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seem more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication,  the former President continued.Bush also warned against  a new era of cyber threats  including Russia s attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election, a thing which Donald Trump has called a hoax. Ultimately this assault won t succeed, but foreign aggressions including cyber attacks, disinformation, and financial influence should never be downplayed or tolerated,  he said. Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,  Bush continued.The Hill reports:Bush, who advocates free trade, promoted multilateral and bilateral trade deals during his presidency. Trump is now demanding that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Canada and Mexico be renegotiated, under the threat of a U.S. withdrawal. We cannot wish globalization away,  Bush said, then he went on to urge society to  adapt  to economic and social change.Bush went on to warn that democracies face  new and serious threats  today.Economic, political and national security challenges  proliferate,  he said. And they re made worse by the tendency to turn inward,  he said.  The health of the Democratic spirit itself is at issue and the renewal of that spirit is the urgent task at hand. Our governing class has often been paralyzed in the face of obvious and pressing needs. The American dream of upward mobility seems out of reach for some who feel left behind in a changing economy,  he added.Watch:President George W Bush in NYC:  We ve seen nationalism distorted into nativism we need to recall and recover our own identity  pic.twitter.com/dsiSkFzEVp  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) October 19, 2017While Bush wasn t a great president, he wasn t an evil man (his vice-president was a doozy, though). Donald Trump is so bad for this country that he s making Bush seem like a reasonable president. And at least Bush knows how to form a coherent sentence.

 God Bless Whoever Is Photoshopping These Hilariously Long Ties Onto Donald Trump,"Every once in a while, the perfect pun comes along. You know them when you see them. They re so good, you have to come back and use them again and again. And in situations of discomfort, or fear, or even danger, a pun can be a lifesaver, or an icebreaker, or just something to remind everyone that not everything is serious all the time.Donald Trump presents America with those situations every day. And although there are plenty of good jokes and puns about his hair or his complexion or the likelihood that he has, um, nether regions that match his abnormally tiny hands, none of those are actually perfect. They re physical digs, and those are a dime a dozen.No, the funniest jokes about Donald Trump have to do with ironic things he does, like owning a brand of steaks and famously eating them in a way that makes Mr. Creosote himself, well, sick.But the funniest one of them all rolls right off the tongue because it s already a part of our everyday vernacular. We say  Trump s ties to Big Oil,  and  Trump s ties to Putin s Russia,  but really we could just stop at Trump s Ties: They re f*cking hilarious.

 McCain Responds With Zero F*cks To Give Over Trump’s Threat,"Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) went full-Maverick during an emotional speech Monday night after receiving the National Constitution Center s Liberty Medal. McCain appeared to target Donald Trump and his nationalist base. To fear the world we have organized and led for three-quarters of a century, to abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership and our duty to remain  the last best hope of earth  for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history,  McCain said in the speech.The Arizona senator continued to say that  we live in a land made of ideals, not blood and soil. That was just too much for the former reality show star to take.Trump warned the Arizona Republican, who has brain cancer, and served in the Navy for more than two decades and spent years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, that at some point he would  fight back  and added that  it won t be pretty. Trump, asked about McCain on @ChrisPlanteShow: ""I'm being very, very nice. But at some point I fight back, and it won't be pretty.""  Steven Portnoy (@stevenportnoy) October 17, 2017President Bone Spurs has been the recipient of multiple deferments and never served in the military, by the way.McCain responded to Trump s warning, saying,  I ve faced far greater challenges than this,  according to a CNN reporter.In response to Trump's threat, McCain had this blunt response: ""I ve faced far greater challenges than this"" https://t.co/nFo24e0dDe  Dan Merica (@danmericaCNN) October 17, 2017In 2015, Trump attacked McCain for being a prisoner of war.

" As ‘Me Too’ Posts Flood Social Media, Video Surfaces Of Trump Bragging About Hiring A ‘HOT’ Teenager","Everyone knows what a dirtbag Donald Trump is when it comes to women. His wives, his ex-wives, his mistresses, and even perfect strangers could literally all be participating in the #MeToo posts going on right now on Facebook and Twitter.The movement really took off after a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano:If you ve been sexually harassed or assaulted write  me too  as a reply to this tweet. pic.twitter.com/k2oeCiUf9n  Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 15, 2017Sophie Gilbert wrote an excellent piece in The Atlantic about the use of the tag to draw attention to the fact that not some, not many, but most women have had to endure some sort of sexual harassment in their everyday lives, and most of them many, many times.But in the middle of it all, another tweet came across the feeds of at least Scott Dworkin s quarter of a million followers on Twitter Monday morning. It s a recently uncovered video of Donald Trump back in 2007 giving a highly-paid speech to the Learning Annex. In it, a woman named Juliet in the audience at one point raises her hand during the Q&A portion of the event, and asks Trump, How many jets do you have and how might I apply to be a flight attendant? Seizing the opportunity to be the jackass he s been his whole life, skeevy Donald has the lovely young woman escorted to the stage. As she approaches, his face contorts into  appreciative  looks and he tells the audience,  I think she s hired, I don t know.  Leering at her body, he puts his arm around her and says, deadpan, You re hired. Trump then proceeds to tell the audience a story. I had a case, it was very interesting. A beautiful girl who was 17 or 18 and applied to be a waitress. So beautiful. She s like a world-class beauty like the young lady who just asked a question about the actress. She s so beautiful. And my people came and she said,  Mr. Trump, she has no experience.  So I interviewed her anyway because she was so pretty. And I said,  Let me ask you, do you have any experience?  She goes,  No, sir.  I say,  When can you start?' Before Juliet can leave the stage, presumably having been brought on purely as a prop for his anecdote, he squeezes her and kisses her. Then he stares at her body as she leaves the stage. This isn t my  interpretation  of what Trump is doing, you ll see in the video yourself. And as if making faces, raising his eyebrows, pursing his lips as he watches her walk away isn t enough, he turns back to the microphone and explains his  addiction  to women: See now, if she worked on my plane, that s like a death wish for me, right? That s like an alcoholic. People are alcoholics. You put Scotch in front of them, it s like [Trump waves his hands around the way he did while making fun of a disabled reporter], it s like, this would be my form of alcoholism. It is so sad that the biggest trend on social media right now is people sharing their stories of abuse publicly, just to spread awareness about how pervasive the problem is  And the country is being led by one of the biggest, most public perpetrators of that kind of abuse the world has ever known.Watch the video here:Featured image via Leon Neal/Getty Images",News,"October 16, 2017"
 Hustler Owner Is So Fed Up With Trump That He Is Offering $10 Mill For Dirt To Get Him Impeached,"Donald Trump is a danger to the nation and the world.

Flynt goes on to say: Impeachment would be a messy, contentious affair, but the alternative   three more years of destabilizing dysfunction   is worse. Both good Democrats and good Republicans who put country over party did it before with Watergate. Flynt is offering this kind of cash that would leave the recipient set for life because he reminds us all that getting rid of Trump would mean  unimpeachable evidence  needs to be revealed to the Congress and to the public.Someone out there knows the dirt on Trump.

" Trump Administration Tries To Fix His Dumbest Statement Yet, Fails MISERABLY (IMAGE)","Donald Trump s administration is probably the most stressed out team the White House has ever seen. While dealing with multiple ethical issues and investigations, the administration never gets a day of rest as they are in constant reaction mode and doing damage control on his constant blunders. Today was the perfect example of an administration that is hanging on by a thread.Earlier today, Trump displayed his blatant stupidity as he gave a speech at the conservative Values Voter Summit. During that speech, Trump shocked over 3,000 attendees (and the world) when he said he d met with the  president of the Virgin Islands.  This was Trump s direct quote: I went to Puerto Rico, and I met with the president of the Virgin Islands, these are people that are incredible people. They ve suffered gravely, and we ll be there. We re gonna be there. We have, really, it s not even a question of a choice   we re going to be there as Americans. Trump apparently doesn t know that HE is the president of the Virgin Islands, because the islands are a part of American territory! As expected, Twitter dragged Trump for this: There s really no way to gracefully fix this, but still the Trump administration had to try. In a half-ass, hilarious attempt to minimize Trump s very obvious f*ck up, the White House released a transcript of Trump s remarks   and crossed out the word  president  and replaced it with the correction of  governor of the Virgin Islands.  CNN s Kaitlan Collins made sure to share this with everyone:It s like the Trump administration didn t even try to be subtle! And how could they? Just as they put out one fire, Trump is making five more. Trump s team doesn t have time or the energy to keep cleaning up his messes   and this pathetic attempt is direct proof!Featured image via Isaac Brekken/Getty Images",News,"October 13, 2017"
" After Whining About NFL ‘Disrespect,’ Trump Laughs And Jokes During Military Ceremony","After weeks of blubbering on Twitter and into every microphone he could find about how un-American NFL players who kneel during the national anthem are, Donald Trump just did the un-American equivalent of drunkenly slapping his dick on the table in the middle of a black-tie dinner.During a self-congratulatory interview with his number one sycophant, Sean Hannity, Trump found himself absolutely bewildered by a military ceremony that his supporters have been breathlessly posting on Facebook and referring to as  what respect for the military looks like : The playing of  Retreat  on the bugle. The song is played as the American flag is brought down the pole at the end of the day and secured for the night.The Commander-in-Chief of nine months had no idea what was happening as the song began to play. As it begins, he first jokes with the human pile of shit he s sitting across from, then turns to play to the audience: What a nice sound that is. Are they playing that for you or for me? They re playing that in honor of his ratings! Did you see how good his ratings were? He s beating everybody! Now, it s not like Donald Trump was  in uniform  as the official leader of America s military while he sat there with the second-biggest* asshole on television. But the fact remains that it s his title, especially in a setting where servicemembers are present. One military newspaper, Georgia s Fort Gordon Globe, describes expected behavior like so:Screen captureI think you ll note I didn t describe Donald Trump doing anything even close to any of that whatsoever as the bugle played its end-of-day call. You can watch for yourself:Complete ignorance of military custom is nothing less than exactly what I would expect out of hypocritical Donald Trump. He s been freaking out about NFL players   who are protesting for their very lives   silently kneeling or sitting during the national anthem for weeks now. He s appealed to their bosses, he s attempted to turn America against them, and he s generally been the most racist asshat on the planet about the whole process.Now we see that his offense at the NFL protests had nothing to do with patriotism, but with trying to dictate where and when it was okay for black people to protest.*the biggest asshole on television without question is Pat RobertsonFeatured image via Stephen Chernin/Getty Images",News,"October 12, 2017"
" Trump Just Made A Major Threat To The Press, Jake Tapper’s Response Is Perfect (VIDEO)","It s pretty clear that Donald Trump has no idea how the country works, or what is actually in the US Constitution.Earlier today, Trump attacked NBC News for reporting unflattering   but true   content about him. The network had first infuriated Trump several days ago when it reported that his Secretary of State had called him a  moron , and most recently the network enraged Trump again by reporting on the reason Rex Tillerson called Trump a moron   which was because Trump wanted to increase the US nuclear arsenal tenfold. For no other reason than because his fragile ego can t handle it, Trump reacted to that story by threatening to take away the press  broadcasting license.Trump made things even worse as the day went on when he actually said,  It s frankly disgusting the way the press is able to write whatever they want to write, and people should look into it. Understandably, there was a huge uprising in opposition to all of this, with one of the most brilliant responses coming from CNN s Jake Tapper. During the opening of his show The Lead, Tapper responded to Trump by telling him to go read the Constitution. With a pocket Constitution in hand, Tapper told Trump,  You might want to start looking into it too, Mr. President. You can watch Tapper shred Trump below:Trump says it s  disgusting  that the press can write whatever they want & people should look into it. So we did. And you should too. pic.twitter.com/Bat9gjZ6R2  The Lead CNN (@TheLeadCNN) October 11, 2017Trump needs to be reminded that he isn t a dictator and that he cannot take away the media s freedom of speech just because he doesn t like what s being written about him.

 Trump Threatens To Shut Down NBC In Early Morning Hissy Fit,"It s time to drag Donald Trump out of office. Because if we don t act soon, the Constitution will be put through a shredder.NBC News has multiple reliable sources. And when those sources tell them something, they pass the information on to the public, whether Trump approves or not.That s because the free press in this country do not answer to a petty tyrant who thinks he should have a say in what the media reports.In response to reports concerning General John Kelly and growing tension between him and Trump, Trump lashed out on Twitter.The Fake News is at it again, this time trying to hurt one of the finest people I know, General John Kelly, by saying he will soon be ..

Donald J.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 11, 2017It should be pointed out that the unemployment rate was already under 5 percent and declining, while the stock market had already reached record highs and climbing before the 2016 Election. Trump has not even passed a budget of his own yet and has not signed a single piece of economic legislation. However, the economic regulations he has killed has resulted in the first monthly job losses after over 70 straight months of growth.Trump then exploded in rage against NBC for reporting on Trump s desire to dramatically expand America s nuclear arsenal, and threatened to strip them of their broadcasting license.Fake @NBCNews made up a story that I wanted a  tenfold  increase in our U.S. nuclear arsenal. Pure fiction, made up to demean. NBC = CNN!  Donald J.

Conservatives would be losing their minds and accusing him of violating the right to free speech and freedom of the press.If Donald Trump follows through on this threat, however, the next Democrat to hold the White House should retaliate by immediately yanking Fox News  broadcasting license.

 FEMA: It’s ‘Not Our Job’ To Deliver Food And Water Relief To Puerto Rico,"If you re sitting at your computer, take a deep breath. If you re reading this on your phone, have a seat. Everything you think you know about how bad the Trump administration s response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico has been is about to get a whole lot worse.On Rachel Maddow s show Monday night, she discussed a small town in the mountains of Puerto Rico called Aibonito, roughly one and a half hours from the capital city of San Juan. If it seems like you re getting a geography lesson lately, that s good   even if it is because of listening to Trump trash talk mayors and citizens or watching him pelt churchgoers with rolls of paper towels.Showing video taken from a moving vehicle, Rachel describes the roads from the capital to Aibonito: Clear. Unblocked. As the cameras travel with the MSNBC team, you hear the point of Rachel s report, which is that after almost three weeks since the storm, FEMA still has not brought relief to the mountain town. And to hear them tell it, there s a reason.It s not their job.FEMA still has not delivered food or water to the completely accessible town. And make no mistake, FEMA knows that Aibonito is accessible at this point, because they ve been there three times. All three times, FEMA was on the scene to  help residents fill out paperwork  to apply for aid. Let s drag that acronym out into what it stands for: The Federal Emergency Management Agency. Heading to a remote mountain town that s been waiting three weeks for food and water to assist the pueblo in asking for help doesn t sound like anyone is managing any emergencies to me.Rachel first ran a profile on Aibonito on Friday, which is how she knew that FEMA had been there three times. After she ran that report, FEMA contacted her show, desperate to let the public know that they had once again made the literally unimpeded journey to Aibonito on Saturday, this time to speak to the mayor and file a report on the needs of the community. Still no food or water in their undoubtedly spacious trucks.The death toll in Puerto Rico has more than doubled since Donald Trump told the residents there that they should be grateful so few had died.But the part that will piss you off is the comparison between how the Trump administration has handled this  emergency management  as opposed to the emergencies in Texas and Florida. Shipping restrictions are back in place in Puerto Rico, making what little aid is coming hard to receive. The administration initially refused to lift a restriction on using food stamps to purchase ready-to-eat food, despite the grocery stores on the island being mostly closed until within the last week, and despite those stores that have reopened jacking up their prices. That s not how it went in the mainland US, where the  white people s hurricanes  saw victims able to use their food stamps to purchase McDonald s on day one, and where the federal government stepped in to help municipalities fight price gouging.There can be little doubt that the  emergency management  in Puerto Rico has suffered from a lack of compassion, and that erasing everything that puertorrique os have in common with Texans and Floridians   American citizenship, basic humanity, dire need   what s left is that they are a Spanish-speaking people. They are brown and seem foreign. They are underdogs, with a flag that isn t the same shape as the flags of the individual United States that fly at the same height: Just below the American flag.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"October 11, 2017"
 Trump Just Asked The Most Unqualified Person Ever To Join His NAFTA Renegotiation Team,"Trump, who keeps promising to either scrap our trade deals, or at least aggressively renegotiate them, is mulling over all the people he could add to his NAFTA renegotiating team. He s apparently not looking for anyone who has diplomatic negotiating experience though, since he thinks negotiating is negotiating. Noooo he actually wants Ron Burkle, co-owner of the Pittsburgh Penguins, on this team because he believes Burkle is great at negotiating.The Penguins were visiting the White House in the tradition of champion sports teams, where Trump praised Burkle s negotiating abilities and said: Ron, how about negotiating some of our horrible trade deals that they ve made? Here s what I want, I want to get him. Oh, I would love to have Ron Burkle. And it s great to have you Ron. But I really mean that, if you want to get involved in negotiating NAFTA, I like it. Because we re renegotiating NAFTA, Ron. The U.S. is entering its fourth round of NAFTA talks, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau s visit to the U.S. tomorrow overlapping that. Trump hates NAFTA in part because he wants trade deals that are heavily even unfairly weighted in our direction. He has threatened to walk away from these talks because he s not getting what he wants.Worse, like the Paris Agreement and the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he thinks terminating our involvement in international agreements is the best way to get his idea of a good deal: I happen to think that Nafta will have to be terminated if we re going to make it good. Otherwise, I believe you can t negotiate a good deal. Said the desert to the grain of sand. This is a man who has bankrupted so many businesses and hurt so many people that way that it s astonishing anyone thinks he s a great businessman. But hey, he made out nicely, so who cares what happened to everyone else?This is how he sees our international agreements, including NAFTA. He doesn t understand international diplomacy at all and doesn t care to   so honestly, is it any wonder he wants the co-owner of a hockey team to work on this? He s going to destroy our economy if he doesn t get other countries to destroy us with nukes first.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images",News,"October 10, 2017"
 GOP Lawmaker: Republicans Are Freaking Out About The ‘Dysfunction’ In The White House (VIDEO),"Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN) is being defended by one of his Republican colleagues following Donald Trump s attacks on the Tennessee Republican. Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) said that Republicans in the Senate and House are frustrated with Trump and added Monday on MSNBC,  We have these conversations all the time. We ve had a lot of these  the emperor has no clothes  moments and I m glad that Sen. Corker has brought voice to this,  Dent said.  We are concerned. My colleagues, my Republican colleagues in the House, I know, and Senate, are concerned by much of the dysfunction and disorder and chaos at the White House. Dent noted that since John Kelly became chief of staff that tensions have eased  a bit  but added that the constant  insults  and  sideshows  distract Congress from focusing on policy. We have these conversations all the time and we have to do better and I think more of my colleagues should speak up,  he said.  They say things privately, they don t say publicly. I said it publicly before I announced I wasn t running. Corker, who is leaving office, called the White House an  adult day care center  and said that Donald Trump is putting the U.S. on the  path to World War III. When you re the President of the United States, your words are policy. People take those words very seriously, and I don t think the President has learned that yet,  Dent said, according to Talking Points Memo.  The President, I believe, has to be much more measured in his rhetoric, but good luck with that. Watch:Sens. Jeff Flake and John McCain have also been critical of Trump s chaotic administration. In return, Trump fires back at them, typically on his Twitter account. There s a price to pay if a politician dares to criticize the thin-skinned president who is putting us on the path to World War III. For example, just this morning, Trump lashed out at Corker by taking a shot at the Tennessee Republican s height.  Because it s 2017 and we re witnessing a dysfunctional reality show.Image via screen capture.",News,"October 10, 2017"
 Black Man Beaten By Nazis At Pro-Trump Rally So Naturally Cops Charged HIM With A Crime,"When Deandre Harris was beaten by a mix of white supremacist Trump supporters, Nazi Trump supporters, racist Trump supporters, and Trump supporters who don t subscribe to any particular single white power group, at a Nazi rally in Charlottesville, his life was changed forever.Not only was this young man forced to deal with the incredibly shitty reality that white people may at any moment turn on him like rabid dogs, but the harassment kept coming.While police dragged their feet in arresting his attackers, waiting only until social media had identified the majority and had given them no choice in the matter, Harris and his family continued to receive death threats from Donald Trump s  very fine people. At the same time, the Nazis worked round the clock to  painstakingly compile the video evidence  that ultimately led to Harris  arrest   yes, Harris was arrested. WCPO reports: Deandre Harris, a black man whose brutal beating at the hands of Charlottesville white supremacists was captured on video, is now wanted on charges of unlawful wounding in connection to the Aug. 12 incident.A magistrate, not the police department, issued the warrant, although a news release said police officers had verified other video that led to the arrest. Harris is accused of attacking a man in the group that beat him.Harris  attorney, Lee Merritt, who called the charge a  clearly retaliatory  effort from white supremacists after Harris used social media to identify suspects in the beating, said his client would turn himself in within 24 hours.Journalist Chuck Modi posted video of the attack, which took place in a parking garage near the University of Virginia campus, on Twitter. In the clip, white supremacist marchers   some in white polos, some in riot gear   beat Harris with signs and poles while he struggles to stand.In case you somehow forgot what happened, here is a refresher.This video is horrifying:Fight broke out. Nazis beat black kid w/sticks at end. I kick one in back 2 help & he runs after me. Kid is safe but bloody #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/kr11a8zQ0K  ChuckModi (@ChuckModi1) August 12, 2017Naturally, the Nazis are celebrating this new turn of events that they apparently helped orchestrate:I would like to thank everyone who helped us with the DeAndre Harris case particularly those who painstakingly compiled the video evidence  Hunter Wallace (@occdissent) October 9, 2017You see, since they have gotten Harris charged with a crime, they can move on to their endgame   which is apparently getting Harris  GoFundMe shut down:We need to stop his go fund me ?

(@FireyChris) October 9, 2017Wallace also shared his thoughts on Heather Heyer, the woman who was run down by a Nazi at the same rally:Did you know Heather Heyer was morbidly obese and died of a heart attack? Probably not because that story didn't fit the narrative either https://t.co/3v3wk1QMoq  Hunter Wallace (@occdissent) October 10, 2017The  evidence  the Nazis collected is 5 seconds of video that appears to show Harris hit a Nazi who was trying to jab another protester with a pole. While one would normally assume that acting in defense of another would be something law enforcement would understand, this is the same law enforcement that allowed a Nazi to try to shoot someone and walk away while they watched.Of course they were going to charge Harris with whatever they could. To do otherwise would conflict with the traditionally terrible response Charlottesville has had to Nazis marching in the f*cking street, attacking people, and even committing murder.Daniel Borden, one of the numerous attackers, has also been arrested in connection with the brutal gang assault. No one else has been charged aside from Harris   the victim.Featured image via screengrab",News,"October 10, 2017"

He s also running for the United States Senate in an uphill challenge against Democrat Claire McCaskill.The problem is, since he announced his run at the Senate, nobody s sat him down for an interview. He has, however, released a headshot to reporters, along with an interview-style, 11-page document that outlines some of his positions:He also addressed whether he favored women s rights, in a way that beggars belief: Chanel (Rion), my fiancee, has given me orders to favor these rights, so I d better.

Now, I m not sure if Sykes is aware of Rockwell s liberalism after he began seeing a psychotherapist for his severe depression (likely brought on by the fact that his art was hijacked by Cold War politics), but he should probably check out some of Norman s later work before he starts citing him as an influence,   la Saturday Evening Post.That headshot, though:Oh, I ve already Google reverse image-searched it.

 WATCH: Fox Anchor Chris Wallace Rips NRA Stooge A New One For Lying About Gun Control,"Chris Wallace tore this prick apart.It s only been a week since a gunman shot and killed 58 people and wounded nearly 500 in Las Vegas with a fully automatic assault weapon.On Sunday, National Rifle Association executive director Chris Cox appeared on Fox News Sunday and began by appearing to suggest that the NRA is only calling for regulating bump stocks because NRA members were shot at the concert. You know, because non-NRA members apparently don t matter.Anyway, Cox went on to once again say that we should not be discussing gun control after this latest mass shooting and that we should wait in the name of  common decency. Host Chris Wallace had a problem with that. You say common decency, let s wait, what s enough time?  Wallace asked.  I mean, here were 58 people killed, almost 500 injured. Is it common decency to wait a day, two days, a week, a month. I mean, it is understandable   I know you don t agree with their solution but what s wrong with saying we need to address this? Of course, rather than answer the question, Cox turned the discussion into an attack on Hillary Clinton and other Democrats, all while whining about them have armed guards. Is that a sensible way to have this conversation, to try to turn it into class warfare, where if you re for gun control somehow you re part of an elite?  Wallace responded.Indeed, after the numerous death threats directed at her during the 2016 campaign, including one by Trump in which he called for  Second Amendment people  to do something if she had won, it s understandable why Hillary Clinton would want security. It s not class warfare,  Cox replied.  It s what the American people want. And that s when Wallace buried him. That s not actually true. If you talk about background checks, if you talk about automatic weapons   there are a lot of people, in fact a majority of people according to the polls who would like to see those gun controls. I have to say that I m put off at the argument, if you believe in gun control, you re an elite. I have to tell you, Mr. Cox, I know very few people  who have armed body guards. One of the few people I know who has armed body guards is Wayne LaPierre. We can argue about the merits of it. But I think to dismiss people and say,  Well, that s just the elite and they have armed guards,  it seems to me does a disservice to your argument. Here s the video via YouTube.A CBS poll last year found that 57 percent of Americans support an assault weapons ban.And polls consistently show that 80 percent to 90 percent of Americans, including 74 percent of NRA members, want background checks for all gun sales.So, Cox was clearly lying and Wallace rightfully called him out for it.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 8, 2017"

On Oct. 4th, half of the residents in Puerto Rico had access to clean water and 5 percent of the island had electricity, according to the Federal Emergency Management Agency website. However, by Oct. 5th, FEMA had removed statistics on Puerto Rico s water and power supply from its website, so now we have no idea of what the island is dealing with and what they need to survive. The only thing FEMA left on its site was good news; not the real news which is very bleak.Information on water access and electricity on the island is available only on a website maintained by the office of Gov.

" WH Staffer Explains Trump’s ‘Calm Before The Storm’ Comment, Proves He Shouldn’t Be POTUS (VIDEO)","By now, most of us   even conservatives   know that Donald Trump has no business being in the White House or running the country.

 Thanks To Trump The U.S. Economy Lost Jobs For The First Time In 7 Years,"After taking office, Donald Trump has repeatedly taken credit for President Obama s economy and regularly touts jobs numbers on his Twitter timeline. Now that Trump s economy is in effect, we doubt he ll be tweeting about the labor market losing 33,000 jobs last month.While some of this can be attributed to natural disasters, Trump has also failed to pass any major legislation.Job growth in August and July was revised down, to 38,000 less than previously reported. Economists expected 75,000 new jobs instead of a 33,000 job loss.The economy has added an average of 172,000 jobs a month over the past year but that has dropped to a 91,000 average over the past three months, showing a trend which is not in Trump s favor.Axios reports:Economists widely blame the disruptive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Harvey for the disappointing number, because the survey methodology dictates that folks who didn t get paid on the pay period that included September 12th are not counted as employed.But the report also revised down the two previous monthly estimates of job growth, suggested the slowdown is not all weather related.After Obama took office, he had quite a task on his hands in dealing with the cost of his predecessor s wars, but he did it. Obama s economy took an upward swing, even after natural disasters such as Hurricane Sandy and the floods which ravaged Louisiana. Throughout his campaign, Trump called Obama s economy  a disaster  but compared to other presidents, that was far from the truth.Fact: Obama took office during the worst recession since the Great Depression when the economy was losing 750,000 jobs a month and already had lost a record 9 percent of GDP. Obama started with a weak economy due to his predecessor s decisions but his final jobs report showed 75 consecutive months of growth.The unemployment rate, however, just fell to 4.2 percent, and we re sure Trump will bring that up. Let s see how long that lasts because the former reality show star is now making war noises toward North Korea. Also, if Trump manages to get the GOP tax proposal in the works, we ll see more reports like this one.But for a guy whose  presidency  has been based on undoing everything Obama has done, he sure did a good job of that with the first loss of jobs reported in 7 years.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty Images.

 Hilarious Video Shows The Moment Bernie Discovered He’s Related To His SNL Impersonator,"The 2016 election cycle was rife with hilarious   and often spot on   impersonations of the most talked about candidates. One such candidate was, of course, Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who was competing for the Democratic Party s presidential nomination. On the iconic sketch show Saturday Night Live, Bernie was prominently portrayed by comedian Larry David. The impression was uncannily accurate   if we didn t know better, Larry David could easily have been mistaken for Bernie Sanders. From looks, to mannerisms, to general speech patterns and demeanor, David s Bernie impression was spot on. Well, there might be a reason for that: It turns out that Bernie Sanders and Larry David are actually related.The best part of all of this is that the two men did not know that they were related until quite recently, and their reactions to the news have been caught on video. They found out via Finding Your Roots, a PBS program that helps people find their ancestry and relatives they perhaps did not know about. It turns out that Sanders and David are cousins.When he found out, David simply said, What the hell. That is really funny. That is amazing Alright, cousin Bernie. Bernie says: You re kidding. That is unbelievable. People say to me, they talk about Larry David, and I say he does a better Bernie Sanders than I do. Well, now we know why Larry David does such a good Bernie impression.At any rate, we could all use a laugh right about now, so enjoy!

" Trump Walks Into Church In Puerto Rico, Starts Throwing Paper Towels At The Crowd (VIDEO)","Before departing for Puerto Rico, Donald Trump hurled an insult at the island, then after landing in the U.S. territory, he continued to embarrass the rest of us. After telling Puerto Ricans whose lives have been devasted by two hurricanes that they are throwing the budget  out of whack,  Trump praised officials on the island with the exception of the Mayor of San Juan, in order to continue his war on Carmen Yul n Cruz.As Trump entered Calvary Chapel, cheers rang out from the crowd, according to The Hill. There were signs in the room which read  Let s Make Puerto Rico Great Again  and  God bless You, Mr. President,  according to a pool report. There are no signs like that visible from the video which captured the former reality show star throwing rolls of paper towels out to the desperate hurricane victims. It s possible, but I just haven t run across any yet online.It s as if Trump thought he was in a Mardi Gras parade, tossing out beads and doubloons to the crowd.While standing behind a table of supplies, Trump said,  There s a lot of love in this room, a lot of love. At that point, Trump handed out a few packages of rice to the crowd, then picked up packaged rolls of paper towels and threw them into the crowd as if he was practicing shooting basketball hoops.A few of the rolls were caught by people in the crowd while another fell to the ground.Watch:.@realDonaldTrump entrega suministros durante su visita a la isla. #TrumpPuertoRico #hurac nMar a pic.twitter.com/aAsND3HRd6  El Nuevo D a (@ElNuevoDia) October 3, 2017It s as if Trump thought he was starring in a game show.Yes, he really did throw paper towels at the church crowd in PR.

" Pat Robertson Says If We’d Only Worship Trump, Las Vegas Never Would’ve Happened","In the wake of any tragedy in this country, there are invariably those who make statements that become indelible. Things get said that we ll remember forever, whether that s a good thing or a bad thing.When George W. Bush said his FEMA Director  Brownie  was doing a  heck of a job,  Dubya couldn t possibly have known it would become synonymous with ironically praising a dismal performance.When reporters are the first to come across emergent tweets about disastrous, high-profile events, they can look just like vultures:Source: TwitterAnd when  spiritual leaders  publicly blame a tragedy on the ills of the world rather than the actual cause, it can leave a similar stain. Remember when Jerry Falwell blamed pagans, gay people, feminists, and  abortionists  for the attacks on September 11, 2001? Of course you do. It was as disgusting then as it is now.Similarly, the man I consider to be the Worst Human On The Planet  just said that the worst mass shooting in American history happened because people talk shit about Donald Trump. Seriously.Pat Robertson, the host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s 700 Club, went on his show Monday and made the predictably horrific statement: Violence in the streets, ladies and gentlemen. Why is it happening? The fact that we have disrespect for authority; there is profound disrespect for our president, all across this nation they say terrible things about him. It s in the news, it s in other places. There is disrespect now for our national anthem, disrespect for our veterans, disrespect for the institutions of our government, disrespect for the court system. All the way up and down the line, disrespect. That s right: People who wish we had a president who didn t act like a schoolyard bully and NFL players who silently protest the murder of unarmed black people across America are to blame for the events of Sunday night in Las Vegas.I have a different belief, Pat. I believe you are responsible for the legions of  Christians  across this country who don t give enough of a fuck about human life to change anything.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images",News,"October 3, 2017"
 Trump In Puerto Rico Disgustingly Tells Puerto Ricans It’s Costing Too Much To Save Them,"Just when you thought he couldn t possibly get worse, Donald Trump lowers the bar. While in Puerto Rico, Donald Trump just told American citizens you re throwing our budget out of whack. Read below:Mick [Mulvaney] is in charge of a thing called budget. Now, I hate to tell you Puerto Rico, but you re throwing our budget a little out of whack, because we ve spent a lot of money on Puerto Rico.If you look at real catastrophe like Katrina, and you look at the tremendous   hundreds and hundreds of people that died. And you look at what happened here with really a storm that was totally overpowering   nobody s ever seen anything like this.

 Bill O’Reilly Writes INFURIATING Blog Post On Las Vegas Massacre – It’s Absolutely Vile,"Like increasing numbers of heartless people on the right, Bill O Reilly has weighed in on the Las Vegas massacre with one of the worst things you can say about any mass shooting. The former Fox News host is an avid 2nd Amendment  fan,  meaning he believes that guns are more important than people s lives, and he reminded us that he feels that way in an absolutely disgusting blog post today. The NRA and its supporters want easy access to weapons, while the left wants them banned,  he says. Sorry, but  easy access to weapons  is a big part of the problem. Stephen Paddock had multiple firearms and clips, and over 100 rounds of ammunition. In videos of the shooting you can hear the rapid fire of assault weapons. Guns are already too easy to get.The fact that Paddock managed to kill over 50 people and wound more than 500 more from the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, which has no balconies or patios, is proof positive that more guns is not the answer. All the  good guys with guns  in the world would not have stopped that. But the above isn t what makes Billo the Clown so repugnant right now. It s what he said afterward, about the price of freedom, that s so vile: This is the price of freedom. Violent nuts are allowed to roam free until they do damage, no matter how threatening they are.The Second Amendment is clear that Americans have a right to arm themselves for protection. Even the loons. Three words come to mind: FUCK. OFF. ASSHOLE. The 2nd Amendment makes clear no such thing. All we can conclude from this is that NRA-types like him no longer value American lives. If they did, they d be calling up all their Congresspeople (like we all should be doing right now) and demanding a thorough review of current federal laws regarding gun ownership to determine how best to prevent things like this in the future. They d be calling their state lawmakers (again, like we all should be doing) and demanding their states do the same thing.The House is supposed to vote on a law that loosens regulations on silencers today. How bad would it have been if Paddock had managed to silence his weapon? It would have taken longer for people to figure out what was happening and even more would have died. But conservatives, both Republican and Democrat, are saying,  Oh, we have to protect the hearing of hunters and sport shooters.  Really? This target shooter knows there are squillions of other ways to do that.  Protecting people s hearing,  is a ridiculous and tone-deaf rationalization for what they re about to do. Lives lost in senseless massacres like this should never be the price of freedom. Any freedom.The time to debate gun laws is after gun violence.The time to debate climate change is after hurricanes.The time is now.#Resist  Alt Sarah H.

 Country Guitarist Who Survived Vegas Shooting Changes Mind On Gun Control: ‘How Wrong I Was’,"Caleb Keeter, a lifelong proponent of the Second Amendment, and guitarist for Texas country outfit the Josh Abbott Band has had a strong change of heart regarding gun control. What changed his stance was  the events of last night  in which a gunman opened fire killing 58 people and injuring 515 others, marking it as the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. While  thoughts and prayers  are offered by the masses after each deadly shooting, Keeter took it a step further, posting a lengthy message on Twitter to express his personal thoughts after the attack.Keeter, who survived the attack, wrote,  I ve been a proponent of the 2nd amendment my entire life. Until the events of last night.   I cannot express how wrong I was. We actually have members of our crew with [Concealed Handgun Licenses], and legal firearms on the bus,  Keeter continued.  They were useless. We couldn t touch them for fear police might think we were part of the massacre and shoot us. A small group (or one man) laid waste to a city with dedicated, fearless police officers desperately trying to help, because of access to an insane amount of fire power.Enough is enough.Writing my parents and the love of my life a goodbye last night and a living will because I felt like I wasn t going to live through the night was enough for me to realize that this is completely and totally out of hand. These rounds were just powerful enough that my crew guys just standing in close proximity of a victim shot by this f ing coward received shrapnel wounds.We need gun control RIGHT. NOW. My biggest regret is that I stubbornly didn t realize it until my brothers on the road and myself were threatened by it. We are unbelievably fortunate to not be among the number of victims killed or seriously wounded by this maniac.pic.twitter.com/0NFjHf3PW2  Caleb Keeter (@Calebkeeter) October 2, 2017Some Twitter users wondered about his change of heart. Why now instead of when a gunman opened fire in 2012, slaughtering twenty first-graders and six adults at the Sandy Hook elementary school.On Twitter user wrote,  It s frustrating that some don t call the fire dept until the blaze is at their own front door. But we need more ppl on our side. Welcome. Caleb admitted that he s done nothing about gun violence which has rocked our country for years, but said he would like to do something now. You are all absolutely correct,  he tweeted.  I saw this happening for years and did nothing. But I d like to do what I can now. You are all absolutely correct. I saw this happening for years and did nothing. But I'd like to do what I can now. https://t.co/5mYA7D90X3  Caleb Keeter (@Calebkeeter) October 2, 2017In another tweet, he wrote,  That being said, I ll not live in fear of anyone. We will regroup, we ll come back, and we ll rock your fu*king faces off. Bet on it. It s OK to be for the Second Amendment and for gun control.  Keeter has a set of brass balls to come out publicly like that in support of gun control as the country music industry has close ties with the National Rifle Association.Image via YouTube screen capture.

 Trump: Mass Shootings Will Stop If Americans Unite And Pray For Peace,"Clearly, Donald Trump intends to do absolutely nothing to prevent future mass shootings.The Las Vegas mass shooting is the deadliest in American history. Fifty people are dead and over 400 are wounded after a gunman used a machine gun to mow people down from his hotel room at Mandalay Bay as 22,000 concertgoers fled for their lives.Predictably, the National Rifle Association has remained silent and Republicans like Trump are only offering  thoughts and prayers  instead of taking meaningful action.Trump fumbled his first response to the shooting by offering his  warmest condolences  on Twitter. Of course, we all know that if the shooter were brown with a Muslim sounding name Trump would be calling this an act of terror and would be once again calling for a Muslim ban.But this shooter was an old white guy who used an assault rifle so the terrorism label won t be used and there will be no call for a gun ban by Trump.And that was made further clear by Trump s remarks to the nation this morning as he suggested that the only real way to stop these violent acts is to unite in prayer for peace. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one. And it always has. We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Our unity cannot be shattered by evil, our bonds cannot be broken by violence, and though we feel such great anger, at the senseless murder of our fellow citizens, it is our love that defines us today. And always will. Forever We pray for the entire nation to find unity and peace. And we pray for the day when evil is banished and the innocent are safe from hatred and from fear. Here s the video of Trump s full remarks via YouTube.Not once did Trump call this an act of terrorism. Not once did Trump mention the need for gun control. He said the word  pray  an insufferable amount of times as if prayer is the solution to gun violence. The only thing he offered these victims was prayers and a reference to the Bible and God.That s unacceptable. It s time for Republicans to acknowledge that white men commit acts of terror and it s time for them to ignore the NRA and do something to prevent future tragedies like this from occurring.This was an opportunity for Trump to actually do something courageous in response to tragedy. He failed spectacularly as usual. Thoughts, prayers, and God will not prevent mass shootings. We need gun control measures now more than ever and a renewed focus on stopping home-grown domestic terrorists. The American people need real action, not false platitudes.Featured Image: Screenshot",News,"October 2, 2017"
" 49ers Defy Trump, Kneel During Anthem In Solidarity With Colin Kaepernick (VIDEO)","Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been essentially blacklisted in the NFL for daring to kneel during the national anthem in order to protest police brutality against people of color. He was the original player to #takeaknee, and has paid dearly for it. However, since Donald Trump has seen fit to attack anyone daring to protest in this way, the tide on the anthem protests has taken on new life. After Trump s original attacks, players throughout the league were taking knees last Sunday. The attacks continued from Trump this week, and players continued to defy Trump. Perhaps most notably, those on Kaepernick s old team.The 49ers had an entire row of players kneeling during the anthem, right in front of those who chose to stand. However, despite choosing to stand, those players had their hands on the shoulders of those kneeling in solidarity. Trump might continue to petulantly tweet at these people who are using their public platform to shine a light on the very serious and deadly issue of police brutality, but clearly things are not going in the way he had hoped.Then again, Trump seems to think that everyone is as tone deaf and racist as he and his mouthbreathing, flag-soaked base are. That is clearly not the case, though. Newsflash, you orange fascist   the world is much less tolerant of bigotry than you might like to think. People are sick and tired of your screaming racism through your bullhorn and using the bully pulpit of the White House to attack anyone who would dare to do the right thing here.Good on these brave players. They ll surely be attacked for what they are doing once again, from Donald Trump s overly active Twitter account.

 WATCH: Kamala Harris Takes Trump To The Black Church In SCATHING Takedown Of His Attacks On Black Athletes,"Everyone is fed up with Donald Trump s blatant racism with his disgusting attacks on black athletes who are using their platform to shine a light on the deadly racist policing problem in America. Case in point   Senator Kamala Harris (D-CA). Senator Harris is one of the few women of color in the United States Senate, so this definitely hits close to home for her. On Sunday morning, while speaking at an Atlanta Church, Senator Harris ripped Trump for his attacks, all the while eloquently and passionately going to bat for the players who are exercising their First Amendment rights. She told the congregation at the First Congregational Church: Let s speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we rightly think about the brave men and women from all backgrounds who proudly defend the freedom of those they may never meet and people who will never know their names. When we sing  The Star-Spangled Banner,  we also think about those marching in the streets who demand that the ideals of that flag represent them too. That s exactly right. America is a wonderful ideal, but it isn t applied to everyone equally. That often has deadly consequences, and we see this racist pattern over and over again. That flag belongs to all of us, and until things are truly equal, it is not just a right to protest this injustice. It is a responsibility. Sure, the racists of America would have us believe that the flag and the nation belong to them. They want people to remain second-class citizens. Of course, they will never say it. Instead, they want to pretend that the last 52 years erased the attitudes that contributed to the white supremacy upon which this nation was founded.We all know that it isn t true, though. Good on Kamala Harris for speaking truth to power. She will surely be attacked by Trump, but this strong woman of color will not be intimidated by that orange fool.Watch her epic speech below:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2017"
" NBA Kowtows To Racists, Orders Players To Stand For Anthem","For the last two weeks, Donald Trump has been stoking the fires of racial division in America by viciously attacking NFL stars who have decided to take a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality against black and brown people. Of course, all of that escalated when Golden State Warriors Guard Stephen Curry   possibly the most popular player in the NBA right now   said he didn t want to go to the White House to see Trump. Of course, Trump took personal offense at that, and one of the other big stars in the NBA, LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers, called Trump a  bum  on Twitter.U bum @StephenCurry30 already said he ain't going! So therefore ain't no invite. Going to White House was a great honor until you showed up!  LeBron James (@KingJames) September 23, 2017Now, it seems that the NBA has decided to, instead of giving their players the freedom to express their First Amendment rights, give in to the racists of the nation, and to Trump s petty, petulant, racist bullying by requiring that all players stand for the anthem. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver sent around a memo that said that all players are expected to stand. Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum says that the pre-game moments should be utilized  to demonstrate your commitment to the NBA s core values of equality, diversity, inclusion and serve as a unifying force in the community. This is disgraceful. The NBA is 82% black men. It is their lives on the line, and the lives of others like them, in this racist society. They have every right to protest peacefully. Sure, stand.

These are Americans,  Schilling said on Fox & Friends Sunday.  If this were Houston, Texas there d be 55,000 soldiers on this island right now. All have said that the president did everything in a pace that they ve never seen before as far as him releasing money and releasing assets into these theaters,  Schilling said.  The execution on the ground has been horrifying in some cases. I m a student of military history.

" Trump Lashes Out At Puerto Ricans, Calls Them ‘Ingrates’ In Self-Congratulatory Tweets","Again, these are AMERICAN citizens he is talking about.If Donald Trump had treated Texas and Florida the way he is treating Puerto Rico right now, there would be riots in the streets and massive protests in front of the White House.But apparently, people don t seem to understand that the people of Puerto Rico are American citizens who should be given the same respect and treatment that Texans and Floridians received after hurricanes slammed their states.Trump has not done that so far. Not only was he too slow in responding because he focused more on trying to force NFL players to stand during the national anthem, he has not sent nearly enough troops or equipment or supplies to Puerto Rico. And he is insulting them to add insult to injury.Trump has taken to Twitter to constantly brag about the recovery operation despite his response being worse than President George W. Bush s response to Hurricane Katrina. Puerto Rico was devastated by two Category 5 hurricanes, yet less water and food has been sent to the island.When Trump s administration tried to frame the disaster as a  good news story,  San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz fired back by pointing out that people are dying. Trump threw a temper tantrum in response and suggested that Puerto Ricans are lazy people who won t help themselves.On Sunday morning, Trump lashed out again. While bragging about the recovery effort as if it s the best recovery effort in history, Trump congratulated himself and called Puerto Ricans who criticize the weak effort  ingrates.

 Trump Tries Shaming NFL With Video Of Hockey Fans Standing For Anthem And Humiliates Himself,"After an epic Twitter tantrum in which he yelled at Puerto Rico for being knocked down by two hurricanes and cried giant crocodile tears about  fake news,  Trump decided he d try shaming the NFL with a video from an NHL game. At that game, the audience stands up and sings the national anthem. One might think that this just happened, but it didn t. The video in question is almost a year old.19,000 RESPECTING our National Anthem! #StandForOurAnthem?? pic.twitter.com/czutyGaMQV  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 1, 2017The original video is on NHL on NBC Sports  Facebook page, dated Nov. 9, 2016. The day after the election that gave us this walking shitshow to begin with. Why does this matter? Because Trump is still going on about NFL players kneeling during the anthem on Twitter. Earlier today, in the midst of all the ranting about nobody giving him his due credit for the farce of a relief effort in Puerto Rico, he tweeted this:Very important that NFL players STAND tomorrow, and always, for the playing of our National Anthem. Respect our Flag and our Country!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2017He brought the issue into sharp relief last week when he went on a tear about  disrespect  to the flag and called on NFL owners to fire players who won t stand. Many NFL players retaliated by kneeling, the Pittsburgh Steelers didn t even come out of the locker room, and many owners issued statements rebuking Trump in one way or another.So Trump, in an attempt to shame what the NFL is doing now, shares a video that s a year old. In truth, the NHL seems rather split on how they feel about kneeling during the national anthem. There are, however, several players and coaches who believe it s everyone s right to protest how they see fit, as part of the First Amendment. Trump just embarrassed the hell out of himself.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"October 1, 2017"
" Trump Is Too Incompetent To Handle Disaster On An Island, But Obama Handled One Just Fine","Trump has spent an awful lot of time whining about Puerto Rico being an island with a devastated infrastructure, claiming that s the reason our relief effort has been so slow and disorganized: The response and recovery effort probably has never been seen for something like this. This is an island surrounded by water. Big water. Ocean water. He also said: This is a thing called the Atlantic Ocean. This is tough stuff. Gee, these complaints are reminiscent of when he said nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated. With this administration,  It s really difficult, we re doing all we can,  is code for,  I don t really care about this at all unless I can find a way to make myself look good here. But are we really having problems because Puerto Rico is an island, making it different than Florida and Texas, which were also devastated by hurricanes? Current evidence suggests otherwise: Supplies are just sitting in shipping containers there because there are too few truck drives, and too many blocked roads. One has to wonder why we don t have more personnel there helping the Puerto Rican government to clear the roads so that supply lines can reopen and we can help get those supplies to where they re most needed. One person even said that the personnel who are there just seem to be modeling their uniforms. That suggests we have a lot of people who don t know what they re supposed to be doing on the ground there. That would be a failure on our part, not Puerto Rico s.But then there s how Obama handled natural disasters on islands. In 2010, Haiti, which is practically next door to Puerto Rico in the Caribbean (not the Atlantic Ocean), suffered an absolutely devastating earthquake. Despite the fact that we had no warning for that quake (we had plenty of warning for Maria), President Obama mobilized our military  as if it were going to war,  according to the Washington Post. Within two days, we had 8,000 troops on their way to the disaster-stricken country.In less than two weeks, we had 22,000 troops on the ground; 300 military helicopters dropping supplies, and 33 Navy ships aiding the relief effort. Eight days after Maria swept over Puerto Rico, we only had 4,400 troops working relief there, along with 1,000 members of the Coast Guard. Only 50 choppers were working to deliver supplies.The morning after Haiti s quake, Obama told the military that they were  going to respond in Port-au-Prince robustly and immediately, and that gave the whole government clarity of purpose.  Rajiv Shah, who led USAID when the earthquake struck, said: We were able to move more quickly in a foreign country, and with no warning because it was an earthquake, than a better-equipped agency was able to do in a domestic territory. The Posse Comitatus Act places limits on what the military can do in a state or territory, and by contrast, Haiti is a foreign country. Our military response would be considerably different just because of that. But there were over 17,000 troops from 23 states on the ground in Florida after Irma. And the administration keeps saying that Puerto Rico isn t asking for very much, despite residents running out of food, drinkable water and other supplies, and San Juan s mayor breaking down over the Trump administration saying the response has been good.There are complicating factors, it s true. But this is a level of apathy and ineptitude we can t have from the White House when responding to disasters, particularly those where people are dying. Obama showed that being an island is a lot less of a factor in relief efforts than this administration is claiming.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2017"

 New Mexico Is Erasing Actual Science From Their Science Standards," Education standards,  it seems, is now a term fraught with intent. By and large, standards are set by the states that uphold them, with localities left to decide how best to implement those standards through lesson plans, specialized curriculum, and testing. But if you re a voter, you have at some point checked a box on a ballot for someone on a school board, or at the very least a school superintendent. That means that in a time like now, when the phrase  all politics is local  has taken on the most literal meaning you can imagine, local politics can sometimes determine what your children learn.To make matters worse, textbook manufacturers are as subject to political winds   and capitalism   as the next industry. That means they want to produce their books in markets where they can sell the most, which gives big states like California and Texas, whose student populations vastly outmatch those of other states, huge influence over education standards even outside their borders.When a state is reliably  blue,  as California is, that can shake out favorably for proponents of science, history, civics   basically everything where facts are involved. But when a state is more often  red,  as in the case of Texas, it can be bad for those same things.What happens, though, when a state is more  purple,  like New Mexico?We re finding out now. The new science education standards for the southwestern state are raising eyebrows, and that s saying something for a state in which the long-serving Public Education Secretary resigned after 7 years on the job. Hanna Skandera, who was appointed by Republican governor Susana Martinez, had faced intense scrutiny from both Democratic lawmakers and from teachers in the state over previously proposed education reforms.  A through F   grading for young elementary students and a variety of other changes Skandera had sought while serving in the same capacity in Florida under governor Jeb! Bush made her a target of teachers  unions and parent groups across the state.Martinez was very unhappy about the pressure that caused Skandera to resign.But the proposed changes to science in New Mexico were initially based on the Next Generation Science Standards, guidelines released back in 2013 and eventually passed by both chambers of the New Mexico legislature. It was when the proposed changes made it to Governor Martinez  desk that issues arose. She vetoed the bill, citing her authority to properly  vet  the new standards.Now those standards look considerably different than what the legislature passed.Mother Jones outlined some of the changes:Two Democrats in the state, representing Districts 10 and 33, have pointed squarely at Governor Martinez in an op-ed in the Las Cruces Sun-News:During one of the committee hearings, a former member of her staff admitted the reason for the governor s decision.  Toward the end of my tenure at the Public Education Department, I was tasked to edit and change some of the language in the standards to make them politically sanitized. No matter whether changes come from school boards, legislatures, or directly from a governor s office, changes to education standards should never be politicized. Unless this is stopped, New Mexico is just setting a new standard for how other states might politicize them in the future.Featured image via Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images",News,"September 29, 2017"
" WATCH: Adviser Who Wrote Trump’s Tax Plan Says You Will Be Able To Buy A NEW Car For $1,000","Gary Cohn, a Goldman Sachs recruit, now serving as Trump s White House economic adviser and has assets worth $252 million to $611 million, says that under the former reality show star s tax plan you can buy a brand new car for $1,000, but that s not all, folks, In addition to that, you can renovate your entire kitchen for $1,000.

By eliminating the estate tax, the plan would benefit Trump, his family, and other wealthy Americans. So, now we know why Trump was so vague during his short speech in Indiana on Wednesday.We re wondering what Mr. Fancy Pants thinks a new house costs. By the way, the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $33,560. We re sure that s higher now. Mr. Cohn was only off by $32,560. He was soooo close.

 High Schools Start Caving To Trump – Will Punish Athletes Who Won’t Stand For National Anthem,"As if Trump calling for a private organization to fire people who refuse to stand for the national anthem wasn t bad enough, it now seems that some high schools have decided to follow his dangerous lead. Parkway High School, in Bossier, Louisiana, will start punishing football players who won t stand for the national anthem. They could face less playing time or getting kicked off the team entirely.Waylon Bates, Parkway s principal, says that they  require students to stand in a respectful manner throughout the National Anthem during any sporting event in which their team is participating. Failure to comply will result in loss of playing time and/or participation as directed by the head coach and principal. Continued failure to comply will result in removal from the team. Parkway High School is committed to creating a positive environment for sporting events that is free of disruption to the athletic contest or game. And it has begun.High schools are now following Trump s order.Will kick off any players who don t stand during the National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/lfNWyW7z5f  Shaun King (@ShaunKing) September 28, 2017CBS News says that Bates is trying to keep politics out of his schools athletics. He accomplished the exact opposite with this letter, though. In fact, there s a chance now that this will only spur black athletes and their allies to do exactly what Bates does not want them doing.Evidently, the Louisiana High School Athletic Association allows schools to set their own rules about this kind of thing, so other high schools may or may not follow suit here. But the school doesn t seem to care about anything except forcing students to worship the flag. This is one of the replies to Shaun King s tweet:Called them- said constitution doesn t apply to extracurricular activities. Seriously- they said that.  td_port (@td_port) September 28, 2017Too bad for the school that case law seems to be on the side of any students who wish protest, well, anything by not standing for the national anthem. Almost 75 years ago, in the midst of WWII, the Supreme Court delivered a 6-3 decision stating that public school systems cannot require students to salute the flag in West Virginia State Board of Education et al v. Barnette et al. This decision reversed an earlier SCOTUS decision upholding the ability of schools and districts to do that exact thing.This case is generally seen in the context that requiring students to salute the flag can be a violation of religious principles since the plaintiffs were Jehovah s Witnesses. Their religion prohibits them from saluting symbols. The majority opinion, however, barely even mentions religious freedom. Justice Jackson, writing for the majority in West Virginia Board of Ed v. Barnette, tied this to other freedoms protected in the Bill of Rights, rather than making it about religious expression. He held that  freedoms of speech and of press, of assembly, and of worship may not be infringed [on] slender grounds,  and wrote: Censorship or suppression of expression of opinion is tolerated by our Constitution only when the expression presents a clear and present danger of action of a kind the State is empowered to prevent and publish. It would seem that involuntary affirmation could be commanded only on even more immediate and urgent grounds than silence. In this case, Jackson believed that silence didn t  create a clear and present danger that would justify an effort even to muffle expression,  and said: To sustain the compulsory flag salute we are required to say that a Bill of Rights which guards the individual s right to speak his own mind left it open to public authorities to compel him to utter what is not in his mind. Justice Jackson essentially turned the case into one where the government tries to establish its own religion and tries to force its own views onto people; in that case, children. And it could be seen this way in Parkway s case, too, since standing for the national anthem can be considered saluting the flag. The school has delivered an ultimatum to its student athletes: Stand during the national anthem or else.Trump set off a firestorm by calling for NFL owners to fire players who sit or kneel (or stay in the locker room) during the national anthem. Despite the backlash, he s doubled down, and tripled down, and quadrupled down on it, spending a lot of time on Twitter slamming the NFL and completely ignoring the reasons behind the protests (to say nothing of his continued slights to Puerto Rico, which is now in the midst of a humanitarian crisis thanks to back-to-back powerful hurricanes).And now, high schools are starting to weigh in, and it may well be illegal for them to do so. Despite sports being extra-curricular, this is still a school official forcing his students to worship a symbol. And Parkway High School s principal has dragged politics into his athletic program with an ill-advised letter violating the First Amendment rights of students.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2017"
 Wounded Veteran CONDEMNS Trump For Using Him As Prop To Attack NFL Players,"Donald Trump thought he could get away with using military veterans as props to push his political agenda. He was wrong.Marine Staff Sgt. John Jones lost both of his legs in combat in Iraq over ten years ago. In 2007, he sat down for a photograph showing him with the prosthetic legs that allow him to stand and walk.Jones was back in the news this past weekend after Trump shared the photo on Twitter to attack NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.I wonder what this BRAVE American would give to stand on his OWN two legs just ONCE MORE for our #Anthem? #MAGA #NFL pic.twitter.com/3AVqnAlu3F  DONNA WARREN ?? (@DonnaWR8) September 24, 2017As of now, the retweet remains on Trump s Twitter feed.Trump literally exploited a wounded veteran to attack the NFL over protests that have nothing to do with the flag or America s men and women in uniform. The fact is that the NFL players are protesting racial injustice and police brutality. Trump, however, is trying to divide the nation by accusing them of disrespecting the military and the flag.But by using an image of a wounded veteran to push his agenda, Trump opened himself up to being humiliated by those veterans because Jones is very much still alive and able to speak up for himself.And he does not appreciate being used as a political prop to oppose the right to free speech.According to Buzzfeed,Jones says he is sick of military veterans being used as props  to push a political agenda  in the renewed controversy over whether athletes  protests, which they say draw attention to racial discrimination and police brutality, disrespect the military. If you really want to honor the troops, listen to them, he says. Just stop with this sycophantic bullshit and actually do something to support us,  said Jones, who works for Workshops for Warriors, a San Diego nonprofit that has trained more than 400 veterans for skilled manufacturing jobs.  I would want Trump to tweet about that, instead of fueling the fire with the people making 10 million to score a freaking touchdown. And for people (seeing the photo) to say,  Look, he s still standing for this country, and getting veterans good jobs. Jones then went on to defend the NFL players. I ve got my own views about this, but that s why I put the uniform on, so people can do whatever they want in a lawful, peaceful manner. I m sorry, but if you want to know what the real issues are   go to Iraq, or Syria, or Afghanistan, go to places that don t have the freedoms that we have and see how far you get. Protesting during the national anthem is not illegal. In fact, it s protested as free speech and expression by our Constitution. And silently kneeling in protest is peaceful.Even John McCain condemned Trump this week by pointing out that NFL players have the right as citizens to kneel during the national anthem.By using wounded veterans as political props, Trump is the one who is truly disrespecting the military and our nation.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"September 28, 2017"
 BREAKING: Jared Kushner Is Really A Woman And There Are Documents To Prove It,"You know all those times conservatives have said something ridiculous proves President Obama is gay or Michelle Obama is a man? Each time, they say they have  documents  to back their claims and each time they fail.

 Trump Is So Bad Hillary Is Telling Him How To Be President And He’s Doing What She Says,"President Donald Trump has had some strong words for his fiercest political rival, Hilary Clinton, over the years, including having his supporters to chant  Lock her up!  at his political rallies, but now it seems that Trump has bitten off a little more than he can chew with this whole  President  thing and needs all the advice he can get   Even if it comes from Clinton. To make matters more amusing, he is actually acting on what she says!As the carnage from Hurricane Maria becomes more evident, President Trump has been a little too preoccupied with perpetually tweeting abound NFL players not standing for the National Anthem, while hardly acknowledging the fact that American lives are in danger after a enduring a week without electricity or clean water in Puerto Rico. On Sunday, Hillary Clinton had had enough of this madness and took to what she assumed was the only platform for getting Trump s attention directly, Twitter, to deliver a very direct message to the President of the United States:President Trump, Sec. Mattis, and DOD should send the Navy, including the USNS Comfort, to Puerto Rico now. These are American citizens. https://t.co/J2FVg4II0n  Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 24, 2017Clinton s call for action initially took place on change.org when she set up a petition that received 100,000 signatures in just three days, with critics showing their frustration with the hashtag #SendtheComfort. Both the hashtag and Clinton s tweet specifically mention the USNS Comfort, a hospital ship and, in what could be a simple twist of irony, although that is highly unlikely, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long announced that that was exactly what the Navy was going to do just two days after Clinton s plea. We re dramatically increasing the federal footprint that s there,  Long said outside the White House, a motion later confirmed by the Navy.Trump himself commented on the difficulty of getting aide to Puerto Rico, but it really didn t sound as if he knew much about the place, let alone where it is, but still claimed that officials were  doing a really good job. It s very tough because it s an island,  Trump said.  In Texas, we can ship the trucks right out there. And you know, we ve gotten A-pluses on Texas and on Florida, and we will also on Puerto Rico. But the difference is, this is an island sitting in the middle of an ocean. And it s a big ocean; it s a very big ocean. The move to send the USNS Comfort came after days of criticism aimed at the US government for failing to truly offer any aide in Puerto Rico, a US territory of almost 3.5 million people, in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria. Large areas of Puerto Rico face months without power and as well as having an exceptionally long rebuilding process ahead of them.President Trump plans to visit the area next week.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 27, 2017"
" The Worst Possible Person Just Won Alabama’s Runoff For U.S. Senate, And It’s All Trump’s Fault","Alabama s Republican runoff election for Jeff Sessions  vacant Senate seat has come to its end, and the candidate that will go up against Democrat Doug Jones in December s general election is none other than Roy Moore. Moore is the former chief justice of Alabama s state Supreme Court, and he s the one who ordered all of Alabama s probate judges to defy the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling on same-sex marriage in 2013.But Moore wasn t Donald Trump s candidate. Luther Strange, who has been holding Sessions  seat, was the man backed by Trump. In fact, Trump was at a political rally for Strange last Friday when he called for NFL players who kneel during the national anthem to be fired. The president s endorsement usually helps a candidate, yet it s Moore who just won. Here s a little background on Moore: He was yanked from the Alabama Supreme Court s bench in 2003 for refusing to remove a massive monument to the Bible s 10 Commandments from the grounds of the courthouse. That s considered a violation of the First Amendment since it constitutes a government endorsement of one religion.In 2012, Moore won his job back, then called same-sex relationships  sodomy,  and decried the immorality of it all in the wake of the Supreme Court legalizing same-sex marriage across all 50 states. He wanted to bar Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison from serving in office because he s a Muslim, and he accused Obama of using our military for social experiments (including wiping out  don t ask, don t tell  and allowing transgender individuals to serve).He has also defended Putin because Putin seems to agree with him on the issue of LGBTQ rights. One might think that would earn him Trump s endorsement, but somehow, it didn t.All of that should have made this election a tossup given conservatives  current love of Trump, but it didn t. Moore was polling ahead of Strange pretty much the entire time. Why?Well, Trump, for starters. That buffoon endorsed Luther Strange and bragged about it all over Twitter, up to and including through today. He boasted that Strange s numbers had skyrocketed since his endorsement, but according to NBC News, Trump s endorsement actually pushed people towards Moore. Trump won Alabama by double digits last year, but it seems they re souring towards him now.That makes this Trump s fault, at least partly. Voters claimed that his endorsement didn t affect them one way or another, but those who were influenced by Trump said he pushed them away from Strange. What that means is that some Republican voters chose Moore because Trump backed the other candidate.That s a massive blow to Trump. Maybe Alabama voters are ashamed of Trump, and they d have good reason to feel that way. For instance, speaking on the  Rick and Bubba  radio show, which is based out of Birmingham, Trump said: Luther Strange is going to be a great Senator. He loves Alabama, he loves the states and he loves the country. He will absolutely win against the Democrat.Ray will have a hard time. If Luther wins, the Democrats will hardly fight. If Ray wins, [Democrats] will pour in $30 million. Moore s first name is Roy. When Rick Burgess, one of the show s hosts, pointed out that he d gotten Roy s name wrong, Trump actually said that it s not a good sign if the president doesn t know his name. Then he said: I don t know that much about Roy Moore. Roy Moore is going to have a very hard time getting elected against the Democrat.Against Luther they won t even fight. When news of Moore s win came out, Trump tweeted the following:As noted above, the general election is December 12. That tweet has since been deleted, and replaced with one noting the correct month for the general.Where is Trump s influence, then? Rosie Gray of The Atlantic said: The outcome of the special election primary will help answer the question of  who is more influential with Trump s base: Trump himself, or the constellation of powerful voices on the right to whom base voters listen and who are supporting Moore? Well, it seems that Trump doesn t have the influence he thinks he does. Especially given that Strange was likely a far better candidate for Senate than Moore ever could be. Moore is an absolute disaster. He s a danger to the U.S., and in deep-red Alabama, there s very little chance that a Democrat can win Sessions  Senate seat. And Trump s endorsement of Strange is partly responsible for this. He s a blight on the GOP and a blight on the nation as a whole. He s dangerous, and Moore s election is evidence of that.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 26, 2017"
 Loser Trump Fails Miserably Again As ‘Monday Night Football’ Ratings Soar,"Wow, it s like a  president  can t even get a boycott going anymore.

 ‘We Know Where You Live’: Trump-Loving Terrorist Threatens All Who Attack ‘The White Race’ (VIDEO),"Meet James Stachowiak. If he looks familiar, you may remember him as the guy who made headlines for telling his fellow  patriots  to shoot black women and children in the heads if they were seen simply exiting a store during the Ferguson protests. If you re unfamiliar well boy are you in for a treat!Stachowiak has by now cemented himself as one of the dumbest human beings on the internet, on par with right-wing agitator Charles Johnson and  alt-right  fake news creator Jim Hoft. In his latest video, the self-described leader of the  patriot movement  (a phrase synonymous with right-wing terrorist groups) has a threat to issue to those he perceives to be  an-tee-fa  (Antifa in English): if you f*ck with  the white race  you re dead. Since we the patriot movement don t see color, I am now going to pull this mask over my face,  Stachowiak tells his fellow  patriots  as he pulls a red white and blue mask down. The sheepdogs are watching you. 200 million weapons in this country possessed by  We the People,'  Stachowiak says.  12 trillion rounds of ammunition and you people don t even know which bathroom  to use? We grow stronger and more outraged every day. You want to destroy this country and the white race,  Stachowiak adds.  We have news for you. The sheepdogs have one mind. We love our country and we want it back. You will never know who we are,  Stachowiak, who posted the video to Facebook under his real name,  says.  You will never know where we are. He then lays out a plan the  patriot movement  has to lure people they don t like into dark alleys and abandoned buildings to kill them.According to Stachowiak, members of the  patriot movement  are stalking those they think are planning  insurrection  and  gathering intel  to use against them. We will use it against you,  Stachowiak says.  We will create panic in your ranks, fear in your hearts, we will cause you to turn on each other like animals. We know where you live, where you work, where you go to school,  Stachowiak says.  We are looking over your shoulder. The sheepdogs are always watching. We are patriots. We are the new Minutemen. We will defend the flock. We will come for you. There will be no rules of combat or as the military says rules of engagement,  Stachowiak says.  There will be nowhere for you to run, nowhere for you to hide You will lie upon the earth until you are buried in it. Don t worry, though. He s not a terrorist. Just loves his country and stuff.Watch it below:Featured image via screenshot",News,"September 26, 2017"
" The Only Pittsburgh Steeler To Stand For National Anthem Speaks Out, And Trump Fans Will HATE It","Conservatives cheered when Pittsburgh Steeler Alejandro Villanueva, who s also a combat veteran, came out and stood for the national anthem while the rest of the team stayed in the locker room. They won t be happy with what Villanueva has said about it since, though. They think he s just like them, a jingoist among a sport full of traitors to America, and this is really going to ruin that.First off, it doesn t look like Villanueva intended to be defiant this way:Villenueva asked Ben after Sat night meeting if he could be out in front with captains. Agreed to.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Villenueva turned around when the Bears fan flag came in, he looked back to his teammates,then the anthem started. He couldn t walk out then  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017So it looks like there might have been some miscommunication about what they were doing, or maybe that Villanueva wasn t totally sure what the team had agreed to do.He also said he knew, every time he saw the flag on a fellow soldier s shoulder during a mission, that they were fighting for each other. He also did say,  People die for the flag; there s no way else to put it  There s nothing else that would justify dying for that mission.  (It s likely the mission he meant was whatever mission he and his fellow soldiers were on, rather than the mission of fighting for the flag that Trump fans are glomming onto).But it s what he says about how he feels about what happened that will have Trump fans seething. Seriously:Alejandro Villanueva:  This national anthem ordeal has sort of been out of control, and there s a lot of blame on myself  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Villenueva: I made coach Tomlin look bad, and that is my fault and my fault only. I made my teammates look bad, and that is my fault only  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villanueva:  Unfortunately, I threw (my teammates) under the bus, unintentionally.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villaneuva:  Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself, I feel embarrassed.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villanueva:  For anybody who thinks that Coach Tomlin is not as patriotic as you can get in America  I m offended by that.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Villanueva:  We as a team tried to figure it out, obviously we butchered it . I m not gonna pretend I have some kind of righteous voice.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Alejandro Villaneuva:  I will support all my teammates, and all my teammates and all my coaches have always supported me.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017And then there s this:Villenueva says he  absolutely  would be OK if teammates kneeled or sat during the anthem.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villanueva says some players who have been kneeling during anthems have approached him after/before games and thanked him for his service  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villenueva:  Every single one of my teammates is extremely supportive and extremely patriotic. I can honestly said that.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Al Villaneuva:  The team meeting that we had on Saturday night brought the whole team together. Absolutely, We had great conversations.  Chris Adamski (@C_AdamskiTrib) September 25, 2017Trump fans really don t understand why people are so angry at them for whining about professional athletes not standing for the national anthem. The jingoism is dangerously strong among them, along with the cluelessness and blind followership. In fact, many of them are on the above thread and totally, utterly and completely misunderstanding it. They aren t the patriots they believe themselves to be.

 Republican Governor Helped Kill 11 Elderly People By Deleting Their Messages Begging For Help,"Hurricane Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms ever recorded, was responsible for the deaths of at least 102 people, 44 of whom were in the Caribbean. Of the fatalities recorded in the mainland US, at least 50 were in Florida, 11 of which were due to the stifling conditions inside a South Florida nursing home after it lost power. Those 11 deaths could have possibly been avoided if Republican Florida Governor Rick Scott had heeded the emergency calls he had received about the worsening conditions in the home.A criminal Probe has been opened into the tragedy at the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hill, a nursing home in Hollywood, Florida, north of Miami, where five bodies were found inside the home itself, with more patients dying later in a nearby hospital. The Vice President of The Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, Natasha Anderson, attempted to contact Governor Scott by phone on four separate occasions in the two days leading up to the death of the first patient, leaving a message each time about the worsening conditions inside the home and asking for  immediate assistance.  When Scott s office was contacted in regards to the messages, a spokeswoman said, The voicemails were not retained. In what could amount to possible charges of criminal negligence against Scott, the spokeswoman wrote in an email:  The voicemails were not retained because the information from each voicemail was collected by the Governor s staff and given to the proper agency for handling.  Despite Anderson s claims that she requested  immediate assistance,  Scott has stated that nobody from the nursing home said the patients were in Danger or that the situation was at crisis level.Anderson called Florida Power and Light after the 152-bed facility lost power to its air-conditioning at around 3pm on September 10. FPL said they would have crews dispatched the next morning, but to no avail so on the evening of September 11, Anderson called a cellphone number provided by Scott during a conference call prior to the emergency in which he claimed they could contact him him if trouble arose, however, she was only able to get his voicemail. She tried three more times the following day, met with the same result. Patients at the home began to suffer from a variety of health problems between 3am and 6am on the morning of September 13, some of whom had body temperatures recorded as high as 109 . None of this changes the fact that this facility chose not to call 911 or evacuate their patients to the hospital across the street to save lives,  a spokeswoman noted. I am going to work to aggressively demand answers on how this tragic event took place,  Governor Rick Scott said in a statement.  This situation is unfathomable. Every facility that is charged with caring for patients must take every action and precaution to keep their patients safe. The governor has since shut off the facility s Medicare and Medicaid funding.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"September 25, 2017"
" ‘Racist, Fascist, White Supremacist’: Former NFL Star Chris Kluwe Scorches Trump Over His Attacks On Atheletes","Donald Trump is facing seriously fierce blowback for his attacks on black athletes who choose to protest racism and police brutality by taking a knee during the national anthem before games. Everyone from owners to players to players to former players are giving Trump a big middle finger during Suturday s games on Sunday, and former NFL star Chris Kluwe didn t stay out of the fray. During an interview with CNN host Fredricka Whitfield, Kluwe, who believes he was blacklisted in the league for speaking out for LGBTQ rights, did not hold back. First, Whitfield asked: This display of kneeling at the national anthem on a football field started a year ago with 49er s Kaepernick and now has evolved into something else or perhaps has blossomed into the same thing but in a bigger way. Chris, what statement do you see NFL teams, owners, coaches making when they kneel, touch, lock arms on display like this? Kluwe responded: Well, I think that the players and the teams are saying that they are not going to be dictated to by a racist, fascist white supremacist who currently occupies the highest place in our government. When you look at what Donald Trump has said about speaking out against Nazis, I think it s fantastic that players and owners are now taking a stand in using the platform to speak out against this because this is not what America is. America is not a fascist military state where its devotion to the flag above all. Right now our nation is not holding up its end of the social contract, especially with communities of color. It should be a baseline right now that you can walk down the street and not get shot by a police officer for carrying a toy gun or for selling cigarettes out of the back of a car. It should not be out of the ordinary to expect that. So I m glad to see these players and owners taking a stand. Communities of color within our nation are not receiving the same level of justice that white communities are,  he added.  Black members of our society are far more likely to be put in prison for what white members are able to skate by on. But it s also morphed into a discussion that we have a person in charge of our society that does not understand what it means to wield the American empire, and has shown no willingness to work with minorities, with immigrants, with anyone who is not white, and that is, again, against the heart of what America stands for. Kluwe is spot on. These players do not suspend their First Amendment right when they take to the field. Further, Donald Trump should not be using the bully pulpit of the White House to try and get people fired for demonstrating for justice. These players are using their platforms to bring awareness to a very serious, and literally life or death, issue in America s communities of color. There s nothing more patriotic that they could do.Trump, on the other hand, is no patriot. Kluwe is correct   Trump IS a racist, a fascist, and a white supremacist. Kudos to these sports teams for standing up to this bullying.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 24, 2017"
 Golden State Warriors Coach Just WRECKED Trump After Attack On One Of His Players,"On Saturday, the man we re forced to call  President  Trump responded to Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry s refusal to accept an invitation to the White House by doing the internet equivalent of incoherently screeching  WELL FINE,  YOU RE NOT INVITED ANYWAY. Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Unfortunately for Trump, Warriors coach Steve Kerr has Curry s back. The idea of civil discourse with a guy who is tweeting and demeaning people and saying the things he s saying is sort of far-fetched,  Kerr said on Sunday.  Can you picture us really having a civil discourse with him? It was an actual chance to talk to the president,  he said.  After all, he works for us. He s a public servant. He may not be aware of that, but he is a public servant, right? So maybe as NBA champions, as people in a prominent position, we could go in and say,  This is what s bothering us, what can we do about this?'  Then he laid in to Trump for attacking black football players for exercising their First Amendment rights while calling Nazis  very fine people: How about the irony of  Free speech is fine if you re a neo-Nazi chanting hate slogans, but free speech is not allowed to kneel in protest?  No matter how many times a football player says,  I honor our military, but I m protesting police brutality and racial inequality,  it doesn t matter. Nationalists are saying,  You re disrespecting our flag.  Well, you know what else is disrespectful to our flag? Racism. And one s way worse than the other. Trump is a constant embarrassment to our country.Watch Kerr rip him apart below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 24, 2017"
 Trump Declares War On NFL In Early Morning Twitter MELTDOWN,"Donald Trump is now obsessed with attacking the NFL.On Friday night, Trump demanded that NFL team owners fire any player who kneels during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and called NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick a  son of a bitch. Seriously, Trump just publicly insulted a private citizen and called for dozens of firings. This is the so-called President of the United States.Apparently, Trump is tired of North Korea not giving in to his demands so he picked a new target closer to home.After much criticism, Trump jumped on Twitter to throw a temper tantrum on Saturday night.If a player wants the privilege of making millions of dollars in the NFL,or other leagues, he or she should not be allowed to disrespect .  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017 our Great American Flag (or Country) and should stand for the National Anthem. If not, YOU RE FIRED. Find something else to do!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Roger Goodell of NFL just put out a statement trying to justify the total disrespect certain players show to our country.Tell them to stand!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017But Trump clearly went to bed angry because he woke up early on Sunday morning to continue his hissy fit.If NFL fans refuse to go to games until players stop disrespecting our Flag & Country, you will see change take place fast. Fire or suspend!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017 NFL attendance and ratings are WAY DOWN. Boring games yes, but many stay away because they love our country. League should back U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017That s right, Trump literally just called for a boycott of an American business because it s not racist enough and suggested that the NFL is anti-American for not punishing players for exercising their constitutional rights. Kneeling during the national anthem is a protest against racial injustice, and so far, it has been working. Attention has been brought to the issue. But Trump wants owners to start firing players who kneel or force them to stand, which would likely see a bunch of lawsuits filed against the NFL.Refusing to stand during the national anthem is protected as free speech and expression by the Constitution. It would be like forcing kids to stand and say the Pledge of Allegiance in school, which is what Trump will probably do next after he gets humiliated by the NFL.The NFL can do that by making sure Colin Kaepernick gets signed by a team. And every NFL player should kneel during the anthem in solidarity with their fellow teammates. Their teammates are under attack by Donald Trump now. It s time to kneel together, not just to protest racism, but to protest him as well. Because Trump is the biggest racist of them all.Featured Image: David Becker / Stringer via Getty",News,"September 24, 2017"
 Trump Just Threatened To Murder 25 Million People Because Words Offended Him,"On Saturday night, Donald Trump once again casually threatened nuclear war against the country of North Korea. The last time he did that, he came back with an arguably weak package of sanctions, which penalized only individuals doing business with the dictatorship. This time, Snowflake Trump was triggered by North Korea s Foreign Minister speaking at the UN.Ri Yong Ho told the assembly that the week s exchange of insults between Trump and his apparent arch-nemesis Kim Jong Un made our rocket s visit to the entire US mainland inevitable all the more,  apparently threatening to aim North Korean missiles directly at the United States. The isolated peninsular nation, by all accounts, is years away from developing technology that will actually reach us.Trump  fired  back:Just heard Foreign Minister of North Korea speak at U.N. If he echoes thoughts of Little Rocket Man, they won't be around much longer!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2017Trump has now added an adjective to his new nickname for Kim, further Trumpifying  Rocket Man  into what he surely believes is a dagger through the heart of the 33-year-old dictator. They won t be around,  of course, includes the 25 million inhabitants of North Korea, as even the smallest of our nuclear weapons would cause inconceivable damage to the geographically insignificant country.Trump is undoubtedly attempting to deflect some attention away from his weekend misadventures in Alabama, which earned him the scorn of every sports fan in America over his racist call for NFL owners to fire players who kneel during the national anthem.  Unpatriotic,  he calls it. I don t think Donald Trump knows what patriotism is.It certainly isn t making America look like a global bully that takes offense at the most meaningless of statements from a hostile foreign minister.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"September 24, 2017"
 Trump Insults John McCain For Refusing To Strip Healthcare From Millions Of Americans,"John McCain survived brutal torture and six years as a prisoner of war during Vietnam. If Donald Trump thinks he can intimidate him, he should think again.On Friday, the Arizona senator released a statement announcing his intention to vote against the Graham-Cassidy bill that Republicans have introduced to repeal Obamacare.The bill would strip healthcare from 30 million Americans, and turn Medicaid into a block grant program that would cease to exist after a few years. The bill also gives states the power to obtain waivers so that insurance companies can discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions. America s healthcare system would be thrown into dire chaos, and Trump is absolutely okay with that.McCain is not.The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.Senators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won t be available by the end of the month, we won t have reliable answers to any of those questions.And for that, Trump viciously attacked McCain.John McCain never had any intention of voting for this Bill, which his Governor loves. He campaigned on Repeal & Replace. Let Arizona down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Arizona had a 116% increase in ObamaCare premiums last year, with deductibles very high. Chuck Schumer sold John McCain a bill of goods. Sad  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017Large Block Grants to States is a good thing to do. Better control & management. Great for Arizona. McCain let his best friend L.G. down!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017First off, block grants are not enough to cover all the people who desperately need healthcare. In fact, it limits funding to the point where state officials will have to decide who gets care and who doesn t to avoid using up the grant money on expensive treatments, which sounds a lot like a death panel.Second, Lindsey Graham s friendship with McCain does not mean they vote the same, as Graham made clear on Twitter.My friendship with @SenJohnMcCain is not based on how he votes but respect for how he s lived his life and the person he is.  Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) September 22, 2017Obamacare has its flaws, but those flaws can be fixed easily with bipartisan legislation. McCain understands this and he understands that repealing Obamacare would leave tens of millions of Americans without healthcare, including millions of conservatives in red states.Donald Trump is an asshole. He wants to kill a major healthcare law just because it is known as Obamacare and because he is desperate for major legislation to sign. He hasn t even actually read the damn bill, which medical organizations and the healthcare industry agree is terrible.Besides, if Trump wanted McCain s vote so much he should have thought of that before criticizing him for being a POW.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 23, 2017"
 Trump Whines That The Media Wouldn’t Film His Crowd In Alabama – CNN Makes A Fool Out Of Him,"Trump s desperation to convince people that the Great Liberal Media Conspiracy Against Him is real is getting way out of control. On Twitter earlier, he cried that nobody was asking about the media s totally biased coverage of Hillary during the election. He also claimed at a rally a while back that the press was turning their cameras off during his speech because they didn t want their audiences to hear what he had to say. CNN made him look stupid for that. Then tonight, in Alabama, he did it again, and CNN made him look even worse for it.He said,  Fake news. They won t show this,  referring to his obsession with his crowd sizes. He then went on to say: They ll say  Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night. It was a small crowd. A very unenthusiastic crowd. It was a terrible evening. CNN had split the screen between him and his crowd before he started this diatribe. Seriously   he said this while CNN was showing his crowd.

 Scaramucci TV Appearance Goes Off The Rails As Show Brings Special Guest To Mock Him (VIDEO),"The most infamous characters from Donald Trump s administration are resurfacing and coming back to haunt him. Just a few days ago, former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer made an appearance at the Emmys to mock his old boss, and now former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci has made a television appearance as well. Basically, Trump should be terrified if this keeps happening.Anthony Scaramucci s short-lived role in the White House was pure insanity for the entirety of its 11 days. From day one, he became polarizing and controversial, causing several actors to rush at the opportunity to imitate him   including comedian Mario Cantone, who became known for his perfect impersonation of  the Mooch.  Little did Scaramucci know, his memorable time as Communications Director would come back to bite him in the a**.On Friday, Scaramucci appeared on The View, where he was suddenly confronted with a surprise appearance by Cantone, who called Scaramucci his doppelg nger.  Cantone sat right next to Scaramucci and said: Look at this guy! He s my doppelg nger! Scaramucci was more than uncomfortable and tried to get Cantone to stop imitating him by asking semi-serious questions. Scaramucci asked: How bummed were you when I was fired? You were on your way. And then you got shot like a little bird and hit the water. You had to be bummed. Unfortunately for the Mooch, Cantone continued to imitate him and landed this epic diss: You re lucky you re here. You got nothing. Spicer got the EMMYs. You re sitting here with four bleeding heart chiacchierones. Scaramucci tried to be a good sport for the rest of the show, but he was visibly irked by Cantone s portrayal of him as he spoke about his time as Communications Director.You can watch Scaramucci hate every second of this surprise appearance below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images",News,"September 22, 2017"
 Anti-Porn GOP Florida Lawmaker Was Just Caught Porning On Twitter,"The GOP has a thing for porn. In 2016, Sen. Todd Weiler introduced legislation asking his state to recognize that porn is creating a public health hazard and Republicans thought that was a cool idea. Well, now it s 2017 and a Florida lawmaker who filed a similar proposal was just busted favoriting a porn tweet. You could say he got Ted Cruzed.Just a few days ago, State Rep. Ross Spano filed a bill to declare pornography a public health crisis in Florida, but from his Twitter account, it appears he  liked  a pornographic tweet.According to the Orlando Weekly, the Republican s list of likes on Twitter is typically football clips, Bible verses, and GOP-related content about how evil Islam is. But, nestled into his  likes  list is a tweet from Jan. 8 by the  Goddess Lesbian  Twitter account, which features a video clip from adult entertainment company Reality Kings. On that same day, Spano liked a Biblical quote-tweet from Franklin Graham but we re not sure if that was before or after he was watching lesbians having sexy-time in front of the camera.Screenshot!This wouldn t matter in the least except for the bill Spano filled, HR157, which the Orlando Weekly notes is  incredibly harsh on adult content  and he left that  liked  porn tweet up for nine months. It appears to be deleted now. Franklin Graham s liked tweet is still there, though.The bill, which is contrary to research, states that  recent research indicates that pornography is potentially biologically addictive, resulting in the user consuming increasingly more shocking material to satisfy the addiction,  and adds,  Pornography has a detrimental effect on families and is linked to a reluctance to enter into marriage, dissatisfaction in marriage and marital infidelity. Spano says he didn t do it. It wasn t him being horny on Twitter.Obviously, I have a long social media history on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram since I was first elected in 2012. With a thorough examination of my accounts, it will be easy to see that this is not my doing. I have since gone back, once notified, and rectified the problem. And I m now looking into how it occurred in the first place.In addition, referencing my prior statement, I don t believe any of this takes the focus off of the fact that there is a direct correlation between pornography and a host of societal problems, including human trafficking, exploitation of children, sex slavery, and domestic violence.Sure, it wasn t Spano, it must have been that other Spano guy with the same Twitter account and password. Sounds legit!Image via YouTube screen capture.",News,"September 21, 2017"
 Obama Just Made A VERY Powerful Statement About Trump’s Attempts To Repeal Obamacare (VIDEO),"President Barack Obama appeared today at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation s  Goalkeepers  event, an event aimed at effecting change on a global scale in the areas of world hunger, education access and quality, clean energy, healthcare, gender equality, clean water, climate action, and a host of other goals the Foundation wants to help us work toward.Many speakers were on hand for the event, including President Obama, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, will.i.am, Malala, Stephen Fry, and more, all with stories of empowerment and positive change and possibility. But in America s current climate of fear and unease about what will happen with health care in this country, it was President Obama s speech that was particularly emblematic of the struggle we face in determining the outcome of the American way of life when it comes to insurance, medical care, and ongoing health concerns.This is in stark contrast with what we see in everyday life in America, where we seemingly can t even agree on whether or not white supremacists are bad, or if it s okay to run over protesters. We are engaged in a fight for our very lives, and at least legislatively speaking, Obama knows how hard it looks from where we are.From the video you re about to watch: [W]hen I see those people trying to undo that hard-won progress, for the 50th or 60th time, with bills that would raise costs or reduce coverage, or roll back protections for older Americans or people with pre-existing conditions   the cancer survivor, the expecting mom, or the child with autism, or asthma, for whom coverage once again would be almost unattainable  it is aggravating.And all of this being done without any demonstrable economic, or actuarial, or plain common sense rationale   it frustrates. And it s certainly frustrating to have to mobilize every couple months to keep our leaders from inflicting real human suffering on our constituents. President Obama couldn t be more right. Although he is diplomatic here and does not call out Donald Trump and the Republicans by name, it is vital that we hold them to account. It is absolutely imperative that we make sure they cannot tear away at the fabric of our society and rip away at the moral cloth we ve woven in beginning the process of ensuring every American has access to health care.Watch the video here:Featured image via Yana Paskova/Getty Images",News,"September 20, 2017"
 WATCH: Morgan Freeman Uses His Brilliant Movie Scripting Skills To Explain Just How Dangerous The Russia Scandal Is,"So many people want to call the Special Counsel investigation into the Trump campaign s potential collusion with the Russian government to fix the 2016 presidential election  fake news.  They listen to every word out of Donald Trump s mouth, all the while being blind to his systematically dismantling our democratic institutions   and potentially our republic as we know it. However, there is a huge anti-Trump resistance movement going, and we aren t going to sit idly by while this dangerous man   potentially with the aid of the Russian government   destroys all we hold dear as a nation. Well, whether the government cares about this or not, plenty of ordinary   and not so ordinary   citizens do care. One such person is iconic actor Morgan Freeman.Freeman has joined with other concerned citizens to raise awareness about the seriousness of the Russia probe. In his trademark, unmistakable baritone, Freeman announces in a new video for the newly launched Committee to Investigate Russia: We have been attacked. We are at war. Also with this new and potentially powerful organization is actor Rob Reiner. In his most ominous and godly voice, Freeman continues in the Committee s launch video: My fellow Americans, during this past election, we came under attack by the Russian government. I ve called on Congress and our intelligence community to use every resource available to conduct a thorough investigation to determine exactly how this happened. Freeman couches the whole thing as if it were some wildly brilliant movie script   but in the end reminds us all that it s not, that this is indeed very real and that Trump and Russia are very dangerous. Therefore, we must act.Also involved in the project are anti-Trump GOPers who have more patriotism in their pinkie fingernails than the cowards in Congress could ever know such as radio host Charlie Sykes and Atlantic editor David Frum.This truly is a brilliant project. Perhaps Freeman s compelling voice and brilliant way of expressing this crisis will break the Trump fever before we all perish from it.

 Trump Just Became First President In Modern History To Use Campaign Funds For Criminal Defense,"Donald Trump has been fundraising like crazy for his re-election campaign, having filed his papers the day he was inaugurated for his first term. But there s quite possibly an odd reason for his incessant begging for funds: According to Reuters, he s using the money to pay for his defense team in the Russia scandal.Reuters spoke to two people who are familiar with the situation, but they were unable to determine how much has already been spent on legal fees. Federal election laws allow candidates to spend private campaign donations on legal matters, but up until now, the legal matters in question dealt with routine and mundane things such as compliance requirements and ballot access issues.Trump may well become the first president in the modern campaign finance era to use his donations to pay for a criminal defense in addition to routine legal matters. One of the biggest reasons that candidates shifted largely from public financing to private financing for their election campaigns is so they have greater flexibility in how they spend that money. That helps to give Trump greater latitude to spend donations on his own legal defense. Furthermore, since the Russia scandal is something that may not have existed had he not been elected, Trump and his family may well be legally free to spend their donors  dollars on Russia.His campaign organization currently has nearly $12 million. When Reuters asked Trump s lead attorney how the bills were getting paid, he snapped,  That s none of your business. Trump spent a large chunk of his campaign funding on his own properties during the 2016 election cycle, and has been spending government money at some of those same properties, lining his pockets with public dollars. His campaign has paid one law firm Jones Day almost $4 million, some of which probably did go to help with the Russia probe. Jones Day has also responded to inquiries related to Russia, including sending documents to Congress on the campaign s behalf.Here s the sad thing: His donors, whether they know where their money is going or not, would probably cheer their chance to help Trump defeat the liberal conspiracy that is the Russia probe. They think they re helping him get re-elected in 2020, so they think they re helping him defeat the great deep-state witch hunt.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2017"
 Trump Doesn’t Want You To Know About This Study That PROVES Refugees Contribute To Our Economy,"Trump administration officials who were under pressure from the White House scrapped a study which found that refugees had brought in more government revenue overall than they had cost in benefits, the New York Times reports. The Trump administration has been unable to rationalize its move to reduce the number of refugees allowed into the United States next year, so it rejected a study by the Department of Health and Human Services which concluded that refugees brought in $63 billion more in government revenues over the past ten years than they cost.The New York Times reports:The draft report, which was obtained by The New York Times, contradicts a central argument made by advocates of deep cuts in refugee totals as President Trump faces an Oct. 1 deadline to decide on an allowable number. The issue has sparked intense debate within his administration as opponents of the program, led by Mr. Trump s chief policy adviser, Stephen Miller, assert that continuing to welcome refugees is too costly and raises concerns about terrorism.Alt-Right leader Richard Spencer has claimed that he was a mentor of Stephen Miller s and said that his mentee is a white nationalist. Miller denied that affiliation with Spencer, but his actions prove that he s an extremist.The study concluded that refugees  contributed an estimated $269.1 billion in revenues to all levels of government  between 2005 and 2014 via the payment of federal, state and local taxes.  Overall, this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10-year period, at $63 billion. The White House claims that the study was politically motivated. This leak was delivered by someone with an ideological agenda, not someone looking at hard data,  a White House spokesman said.  The actual report pursuant to the presidential memorandum shows that refugees with few skills coming from war-torn countries take more government benefits from the Department of Health and Human Services than the average population, and are not a net benefit to the U.S. economy. According to two sources, Miller personally intervened to ensure that only the costs   and not any fiscal benefit   of the program were considered, so it appears that he intentionally left out a few major details.Trump has filled his administration with swamp-like creatures, including Steve Bannon, who once played a large role in the White House, and Stephen Miller who still occupies Trump s ear.Photo: Alex Wong via Getty images.",News,"September 19, 2017"
 Republican Senate Candidate Thinks If You Don’t Believe In God You Deserve To Be Shot,"Republicans always like to push back on the idea that they are bigots. However, that s hard to believe, considering some of their racist and otherwise bigoted official policies. It becomes an even harder claim to believe when they have openly bigoted candidates. Case in point   Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore.Moore has been removed from the federal bench not once but twice, due to his allowing his bigotry to make him defy the United States Supreme Court. Now, Moore has decided that his next target of American citizens is those who do not believe in the Christian god. In a shocking statement, Moore says of non-believers: You wonder why we re having shootings, and killings here in 2017? Because we ve asked for it. We ve taken God out of everything. We ve taken prayer out of school, we ve taken prayer out of council meetings. This man is a deranged extremist. He gave a speech just last month where he blamed America s march away from religion in the public square for the nation s ills. Well, newsflash, Mr. Moore: America is not, never has been, and never will be a Christian nation. You and your fellow fascist Christ warriors are in for a rude awakening. The rest of us will not tolerate your continued verbal abuse of us, and nor will we tolerate your attempting to enshrine bigotry into law. Considering where you re from   super Christian Alabama   you ll likely win your Senate race. However, I am sure that there are cooler heads within the United States Senate   including other Republicans   who will find this language offensive and outrageous, as they should.You, sir, are a bigot and a charlatan who has no business holding public office of any kind.Featured image via Gary Tramontina/Getty Images",News,"September 19, 2017"
 GOP Implodes As California Passes Bill To Make Congress Censure Trump’s Racism (DETAILS),"About a month ago, Donald Trump shocked the country by responding to a violent white nationalist rally in Charlottesville in a way that was completely vile. Defending white supremacists and stating that  both sides  were responsible for the violence, Americans across the country were horrified that such a racist message could come from the President of the United States. And now, some areas of the country are standing up to it.California is now sending a strong message to Trump and his administration in response to the horrific endorsements Trump has given to white supremacists. The lower house of the California legislature has just passed a resolution that is demanding that Congress censure Trump so that the undeserving POTUS is clear that We will no longer tolerate his behavior. Assembly member Tony Thurmond said: The leader of the free world can t continue to use language that legitimizes the actions of extremists groups that promote hate. Congress must exercise its power to check the president by voting for his immediate censure. While a GOP-dominant Congress likely won t censure Trump, this initiative marks the first attempt to censure a sitting President since 1834   and that should send a strong message. The Hill also reports that California is trying to get other states to join them in similar ways, demanding that Trump should  publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior. This bill follows Trump s own resolution in which he tried to condemn the attacks in Charlottesville. However, he continues to fall short with his weak statements. Refusing to denounce the specific hate groups that are responsible, Trump instead spoke against racism in all forms.  Here s Trump s weak, spineless statement: We condemn the recent violence in Charlottesville and oppose hatred, bigotry, and racism in all forms. Hours before, Trump had doubled down on his horrendous  both sides  comment, stating that counterprotesters were also to blame: You have some pretty bad dudes on the other side also. When you look at really what s happened since Charlottesville, a lot of people are saying and people have actually written,  Gee Trump may have a point. That is seriously disgusting. For that statement alone, Trump deserves the treatment he s getting from California.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images",News,"September 16, 2017"
 Trump Supporters At ‘Mother Of All Rallies’ MASSIVELY Outnumbered By Marching Juggalos,"Saturday, September 16th, 2017 will surely go down as the strangest day for rallies in our nation s capital since at least January, when millions of invisible people attended Donald Trump s inauguration ceremony.Two different gatherings are taking place, quartered in different sections of the National Mall, but surely visible to one another: Trump supporters have come together to put on what they re calling the  Mother of all Rallies,  with expected attendance undoubtedly in the zillions, and a rally with an actual purpose is also taking place. Juggalos, or fans of the band Insane Clown Posse, are in D.C. to protest what they call an unfair label from the FBI and Department of Justice classifying them as a  loosely organized hybrid gang. It s clear which group has the more ardent supporters, and it isn t the one I m calling (for the purposes of this piece)  the Trumpettes. Donald Trump is known for his loyalty demands, but I m not sure he s ever met a Juggalo, because they showed up today:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: People gather for a rally during the Juggalo March at the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall, September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Tasos Katopodis/Getty Images)That s the Juggalos showing up. The Juggalo March, at the time of this writing, is just getting underway.This, on the other hand, is the majority of the Trump rally happening just across the way:WASHINGTON, DC   SEPTEMBER 16: Pro-Trump security forces try to keep people away on the National Mall on September 16, 2017 in Washington, DC.

The Trump rally began, according to the Facebook event page, at 11 AM EDT, while the Juggalo March wasn t scheduled until 2 PM Eastern.The Trumpette organizers have tried to distance themselves from the white supremacists that organized the Charlottesville, Boston, and Portland rallies held in the name of  free speech.  Unfortunately for them, they don t seem to realize that the majority of people who show up at those rallies don t care who the president is, they just want to be allowed to shout racial slurs again without fear of public reprisal.Reaction to the stark difference in attendance was widespread:""The Juggalos outnumber the white supremacists at the Lincoln Memorial today.""   is not a sentence I ever thought I'd write.

 Bill Maher Turns GOP’s ‘States’ Rights’ Nonsense On Its Head In EPIC Defense Of Liberal States’ Defiance Of Trump (VIDEO),"The Republican Party has long claimed that  states  rights  mean that states can do as they like according to their own values, regardless of what the federal government wants. Of course, this is something that has just been used for southern states to do horrible things   like, you know, own people. They used the states  rights argument to justify segregation, to outlaw interracial marriage and abortion, and to basically strip citizens of personal liberty to satisfy the bigots in their citizenry and voting base. Well, comedian Bill Maher of HBO s Real Time has turned all of that on its head in the Trump era.During his  New Rules  segment on Friday night s program, Maher turned it around on the Republicans, pointing out how California s governor, Jerry Brown, is busily defending California s liberal way of life in defiance of Trump s regressive and dangerous administration. Gov. Brown has decided to sign a climate treaty with China, giving a big middle finger to Trump s foolish decision to pull out of the Paris Accord. Maher also pointed out that California will not move to enforce Trump s racist deportation force through its police departments, and nor would there be any attacks on LGBTQ Americans.The real kicker came when Maher adopted a country accent and mocked the insanity of the bigotry of Trump voters   only using it to promote progressive values, such as legalized marijuana and lesbian weddings. He even mocked the tiki torches used last month in a horrifically violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, that left 32-year-old Heather Heyer dead and injured many others.In short, Bill Maher is right. If they can do this states  rights stuff, so can we.Featured image via screen capture",News,"September 16, 2017"
 Ohio Fireman In Deep Sh*t For HORRIBLE Remarks About Saving ‘N*****s’,"A firefighter in Ohio recently came under fire for expressing his  economic uncertainty  (a synonym the media concocted for  racism  while attempting to explain why people voted for Trump) about rescuing black people.If it came down to choosing to rescue a single dog or  a million n*ggers,  Franklin township firefighter Tyler Roysdon says he would save the dog, which is  more important than  all those African-Americans he hates.According to Roysdon s Facebook  likes,  he is a fan of Donald Trump, Duck Dynasty, and far-Right Facebook group  Uncle Sam s Misguided Children    just so you know what sort of person we re dealing with.Roysdon was suspended from his position  indefinitely  as soon as township officials learned of the post, which went viral on social media because that s what happens when terrible people say terrible things. It s also very likely he will lose his job according to a statement from officials: Recently, a Franklin Township volunteer firefighter posted unacceptable remarks on social media.  Upon gaining knowledge of this information, Fire Chief Steve Bishop immediately contacted the firefighter and directed the comments be removed.  The firefighter was suspended without pay until the Board of Township Trustees could meet to determine a course of action.  Chief Bishop does not have the authority to terminate employees.  Termination of any township employee requires a vote by the Board of Trustees. It s unclear if Roysdon s racism has ever affected his work or if he has caused anyone to die, but this is absolutely something that should be investigated.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 16, 2017"
 Here’s What Companies Admit They Will REALLY Do With Money They Save From Trump’s Tax Break,"Trump, like George W. Bush before him, thinks a  tax holiday  on repatriated money will spur major corporations who are currently hoarding money overseas to bring that money back and invest it in America. They fail to take into account that, like other tax breaks, companies are not going to build new factories, plants, offices or stores and hire more people if consumer demand doesn t warrant it. Instead, they ll pocket the money they save in one of any number of ways, and regular Americans won t benefit one iota from it.That s what they ll do with Trump s tax holiday. This isn t speculation or conjecture, this is something to which they literally admit. Bank of America Merrill Lynch conducted a survey of more than 300 companies over the summer, asking them what they d do with all that money they bring back from overseas. Their top two responses were the following: Pay down debt, and buy back their own stocks.The idea that they d use the money for stock buybacks is especially upsetting since this is a known method for artificially driving stock prices up. Rich executives and shareholders then get even richer. Workers see no benefit from it, and the unemployed and underemployed don t see new job opportunities popping up.Literally, the whole point of this practice is to make the rich richer.When George W. did this in 2004, companies voluntarily brought over $300 million back in from overseas. $240 million went to stock buybacks. Let that sink in for a moment   80 percent of the money brought back in from overseas went to stock buybacks. Companies took advantage of that tax holiday to inflate their stock prices and get richer. There was no economic growth from that.The companies that brought back the most money actually turned right around and laid people off.Let that sink in as well.There will be no economic growth from Trump s tax break. Companies are not so broke that they can t afford to expand without some of the money they re hoarding elsewhere and protection from repatriation taxes. They don t need this money to build anything or hire new workers. This is nothing more than the government enabling companies to enrich themselves, possibly at the expense of the Americans Trump claims to love so much. The only way to spur economic growth is to help the consumer class afford to spend their money again. But we can t expect that from Trump   he parrots Republican talking points on this because he knows he can use them to make himself and his most loyal rich buddies richer.Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 15, 2017"

 Trump Fans Are Crying In Their Milk After Their Hero Breaks Yet Another Promise To Them (TWEETS),"Trump made a bad decision, or so his ardent followers seem to think. His attempts to work something out with Congressional Democrats on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and also his remarks that current construction on his stupid border wall involves mostly existing fencing, have set off their ire. Big-time and small-time MAGAsh*ts alike are crying today, because their rigid, purist minds suffer from severe tunnel vision that doesn t include Trump doing, well, what he s done. They want Trump to do what he promised and damn the consequences to millions who aren t like them.Take Joe Walsh, for example. Walsh is a former U.S. Representative from Illinois  8th district, but his big claim to fame is being a deadbeat dad. All he wants is for Trump to cut his taxes and build the wall.

 Another Russian Turns Up Dead – He Actually Saved The World (VIDEO),"It has just come to light that Stanislav Petrov, a former Soviet Lieutenant Colonel, passed away on May 19 this year in his apartment in the small town of Fryazino, northeast of Moscow. You have probably never heard of him, but if it weren t for Petrov s actions (or lack thereof), there is a good chance you wouldn t be here to read this today.If you have seen the 2014 film The Man Who Saved The World, staring Kevin Costner, then you might have some sort of an idea of who Petrov is, as that movie was based how he prevented a nuclear crisis between the US and the USSR, as well as averting the potential for World War III, back in the 1980s by essentially doing nothing at all. That could be a part of the reason Petrov never considered himself a hero. At first when people started telling me that these TV reports had started calling me a hero, I was surprised. I never thought of myself as one   after all, I was literally just doing my job,  he once said in an interview later in life.The date was September 26, 1983 and Petrov was on duty in a bunker near Moscow, in charge of an early warning radar system. It wasn t long after midnight when Petrov noticed a single missile on the screen, launched from the US and heading toward the Soviet Union. When I first saw the alert message, I got up from my chair. All my subordinates were confused, so I started shouting orders at them to avoid panic. I knew my decision would have a lot of consequences,  Petrov recalled in a 2010 interview. The siren went off for a second time. Giant blood-red letters appeared on our main screen, saying  START.  It said that four more missiles had been launched. This left the Kremlin only 30 minutes from when the warheads were initially fired to decide whether retaliation with nuclear weapons of their own was necessary and Petrov just 15 minutes to determine if the threat was indeed real. My cozy armchair felt like a red-hot frying pan and my legs went limp. I felt like I couldn t even stand up. That s how nervous I was when I was taking this decision. Fortunately for all of mankind, Petrov recalled from his training that, if the US were to attack, they would do so on an all-out offensive, as opposed to simply firing a couple of missiles here and there. Petrov took this into account and declined to tell his superior officers, figuring that a system malfunction must be responsible for the alarm and it turned out he was right; the Soviet satellites had actually picked up sunlight reflected from clouds and mistaken it for nuclear warheads, although Petrov s decision to keep the information from his superiors was a severe infraction of Soviet military rules.The incident was kept as a highly classified secret for years. Even at the time of her death in 1997, Petrov s own wife, Raisa, wasn t aware of what he had done and it was only made public when Colonel General Yury Votintsev, Petrov s superintendent, decided in 1998 that his deed should be commended and told the story to Bild, a German tabloid. German political activist Karl Schumacher was so affected by the article that he traveled to Russia to find Petrov and invited him back to Germany in order to give his version  of how he had saved the world from nuclear war, something that had been a very real threat for decades.In 2006, the Association of World Citizens presented Petrov with an award in the UN headquarters in New York, which reads:  To the man who averted nuclear war.  In 2012, Petrov was also honored with the German Media Prize, which has previously been awarded to Nelson Mandela, the Dalai Lama and Kofi Annan.Stanislav Petrov was 77 years old.

 Marco Rubio Just Had The Most Hilarious Reaction To Trump Touching Him (VIDEO),"No one likes to be touched by Donald Trump   not even his own fellow Republicans.On Thursday, the full extent of Trump s repulsiveness was on display when he spoke with Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who was also one of his competitors in the 2016 primaries.Trump was visiting Florida on a tour of the damage left by Hurricane Irma, when he took a moment to commend Rubio, who clearly wasn t having it. Perhaps he remembered how disgusting Trump s behavior was while he was running against him in the primaries, so the look on Rubio s face said it all. When Trump approached and touched his shoulder, Rubio couldn t hold back a grimace and nearly shuddered on camera. You can watch this horrible, cringe-worthy moment below:Watch: While standing next to Marco Rubio, Trump says he hopes Rick Scott runs for Senate https://t.co/9cThL4c0S9  NBC Politics (@NBCPolitics) September 14, 2017Trump was encouraging Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R) to run for the Senate seat that is now being occupied by Democratic Senator Bill Nelson. Trump said to the cameras: What do I know? But I hope this man right here, Rick Scott, runs for the Senate. It s unclear if Rubio was wincing because he isn t happy with Trump s choice   after all, Scott previously suggested that his millionaire buddy Carlos Beruff should take Rubio s seat   or because he really doesn t like Trump touching him.Rubio would be far from the only person who doesn t want Trump getting that close to him. Recently, reporter Katy Tur detailed a truly disturbing encounter she had with Trump, which resulted in the POTUS planting an unwanted kiss on her cheek. It has also been widely documented that First Lady Melania Trump winces or looks extremely uncomfortable whenever Trump touches her.

 Trump Vows To Save America From ‘Curse’ Of Functional Health Care System,"In a pair of tweets on Thursday afternoon, Donald Trump proved once again how out of touch he is with the American public. Just three months ago, Pew Research published a study showing that a substantial majority of Americans   some 60 percent  feel the federal government is responsible for providing healthcare coverage for all citizens. Not only that, but the formerly-controversial idea of a  single-payer  system, like the Medicare For All bill just introduced with wide Democratic support by Senator Bernie Sanders, was favored by a third of Americans.Trump, however, sees universal coverage, enjoyed by every highly-developed nation in the world except the United States, as a  curse  on the citizens of this country.Bernie Sanders is pushing hard for a single payer healthcare plan   a curse on the U.S. & its people  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017 I told Republicans to approve healthcare fast or this would happen. But don't worry, I will veto because I love our country & its people.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 14, 2017Universal coverage was long considered a pipe dream, even as recently as during the primary campaign between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Secretary Clinton dismissed it as an  idea that will never, ever come to pass.  But buoyed by the popularity of Senator Sanders after the disastrous win by Donald Trump in November, the Democratic Party has moved decidedly left on the issue.At the time of Sanders  introduction of his bill, painted as the sane alternative to the Republican frenzy to strip all Americans of non-private health coverage, there were a number of Democratic senators signed on, including those widely considered to be front-runners for the Democratic nomination in 2020. Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, and even the favorites among Clinton loyalists, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand, all joined Senator Sanders in introducing Medicare For All. They were joined by Tammy Baldwin, Richard Blumenthal, Martin Heinrich, Mazie Hirono, Pat Leahy, Ed Markey, Jeff Merkley, Brian Schatz, Jeanne Shaheen, Tom Udall, and Sheldon Whitehouse.The irony, of course, is that even if one considers universal coverage a  curse  as Donald Trump does, the bill stands essentially no chance of passage in the first place. Trump would love to portray himself as a savior of conservative principles, but with Republicans in firm control of Congress (at least until 2018), the odds of Trump even needing to look through his plethora of gold-plated pens to find the one for vetoes are slim to none.",News,"September 14, 2017"
" BREAKING: Martin ‘Pharma Bro’ Shkreli Has Bail Revoked, Hauled To The Slammer","Martin Shkreli quickly gained notoriety during the contentious 2016 presidential campaign by price gouging in a monopoly on a vital, life-saving HIV drug. He instantly became the most hated man in America when he was completely unrepentant when it comes to taking lives due to pricing people out of the ability to pay for their medication. After that, legal battles ensued, and Shkreli was eventually convicted of securities fraud. His original arrest was captured on camera in an absolutely humiliating live perp walk to the satisfaction of decent human beings everywhere. Of course, he is rich, so he was out of jail on bail. All of that is changing now, though, and it seems that the most hated man in America is now going where he belongs: Straight back to jail.BREAKING: Ex-pharmaceuticals company CEO Martin Shkreli has bail revoked in New York securities fraud case, heads to jail.  The Associated Press (@AP) September 13, 2017The Associated Press is reporting that Shkreli has had his bail revoked by the State of New York in his securities fraud case, and will be going back to jail promptly. Hopefully, it is somewhere really brutal like Rikers Island, where his smug, frat boy smirk will be smacked right off his ugly face by people who are a hell of a lot more hard than he is. We generally abhor insane prison conditions around here, and we certainly abhor police brutality. However, considering what this guy did, it s hard to feel sorry for him.In a nation that rarely sees actual justice these days, these desserts are quite just, and inescapably satisfying. Fuck this guy. He s getting exactly what he deserves.This is a developing story.

 BREAKING: Someone Else Connected To Trump Is Under Investigation For Colluding With Russia (DETAILS),"Today, more bad news for Trump broke as yet another person related to the Trump administration comes under federal investigation. Michael G. Flynn, the son of Michael Flynn and infamous for his role in spreading the Pizzagate conspiracy, is under investigation for his role in colluding with Russia.It s likely he s as guilty as the rest of the Trump team, as he works closely with his father.NBC reports:Michael G. Flynn accompanied his father, for instance, on a trip to Moscow in December 2015 for the elder Flynn to deliver a paid speech at a gala for the state-sponsored Russian television network RT. He can be seen in video from an associated event.The elder Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and a former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, was seated at the same table as Russian President Vladimir Putin during the dinner. Records released by the House Oversight Committee show he was paid nearly $34,000 for his speech; RT also paid for Flynn and his son s airfare to Moscow and lodging at a luxury hotel from Dec. 9 to Dec. 12. Several legal experts with knowledge of the investigation have told NBC News they believe Mueller, following a classic prosecutorial playbook, is seeking to compel key players, including Flynn and Manafort, to tell what they know about any possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia. Mueller has brought onto his team a federal prosecutor known for convincing subjects to turn on associates. Any potential criminal liability for Michael G. Flynn could put added pressure on his father, these legal experts said.In other words, any pressure put on Junior is pressure on the old man, who reports have repeatedly indicated the federal government is trying to flip.This is also just one more name at the end of a long, long list of Trump associates with shady connections to Russia. It s pretty clear that Trump thought the campaign was a business opportunity, never expected to win, and wanted to use the opportunity to build Trump Tower Moscow as well as other projects. He courted Russian investors, sought approval from Putin s government and then accidentally won the election, instead of just coming close. There is no other explanation for how amateurish and sloppy these cover-up attempts have been.Featured image via Addicting Info",News,"September 13, 2017"
 Texas Trump Fan Threatened To ‘Whip’ Black Man ‘Like The Slave You Are’ Before Executing Him,"It s no secret that Donald Trump s rabid, uneducated fans are dangerous. The latest example of this is 38-year-old  economically anxious voter  Kevin Parnell.Parnell became furious when his biracial stepdaughter was arrested for prostitution and blamed it on her ex-boyfriend, Jordan Briggs. Parnell sent a number of colorful messages to Briggs calling him a  n*gger  and threatening to  hang  him. I m going to strip you naked and whip you like the slave you are,  Parnell said in one message. You were warned,  he posted publicly on Facebook, then ten he hopped in his white pickup truck and drove to the apartment Briggs shared with  his roommate, Sammie Jones. He banged on the door three times,  Briggs told the  Star-Telegram.  I told Sammie not to answer. I went to the back and instantly froze up. Sammie had answered the door. You know what kind of gun this is, boy?  Briggs heard Parnell say to Sammie.  It is a Glock 40. Then he heard the gunshot that took Sammie Jones  life. Parnell, whose Facebook profile is unsurprisingly littered with posts supporting Donald Trump, closed the door and ran away like the coward he is. Sammie was being so calm,  Briggs says.  He just shot my bro in the face and burned off. Parnell remains behind bars on $500,000 bond, but he ll be happy to know his stepdaughter s case was dismissed.At this point, it s safe to say anyone who supports Donald Trump is a Nazi, a racist, a white supremacist, a bigot, a xenophobe, or is someone who is perfectly OK with all of those things and fine with being surrounded by those sorry excuses for people.. This is getting dangerous.Featured image via screengrab",News,"September 13, 2017"
 White Supremacist Marine Kicked Out Of The Corps After Being Busted Doing Nazi Stuff,"The best way to not get fired, get kicked out of school or booted out of the military if you re a Nazi, is to not do Nazi stuff. Apparently, one Marine just couldn t stop himself and was arrested at a pro-Confederate rally (where we re totally sure it was just about his  heritage ), and took it upon himself to unfurl a banner with a white supremacist slogan   allegedly.Staff Sgt. Joseph Manning was stationed at the Marine Corps Engineer School at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina at the time he was arrested on May 20th in Graham, North Carolina, and charged with first-degree trespass, a Class 2 misdemeanor, the Military Times reports.Manning and fellow active-duty Marine Sgt. Michael Chesny are accused of climbing a building and unfurling a banner with the letters  YWNRU  on it, The Times-News reported on May 27. The letters reportedly stand for  You will not replace us,  which is the slogan for Identity Evropa, a white nationalist group founded by Marine veteran Nathan Damigo.How Nazi is that you ask? Well, you didn t ask but that s the same slogan we heard in the Vice video which showed Nazis storming the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia during the  Unite the Right  hate-rally which rocked the nation and resulted in one Trump-supporting white supremacist using his car as a weapon to mow down anti-racist protesters, killing one and injuring at least 19 others. The  You will not replace us  chant from racists turned into  Jews will not replace us  during the march.Manning is presently in the process of  being administratively separated from the Corps,  according to the Military Times.Capt. Joshua Pena, a spokesman for Training and Education Command, said the investigation is part of the administrative process and its results cannot be released publicly.Manning s career in the Marine Corps lasted 15 years, beginning in 2002, His military awards include the Purple Heart, Combat Action Ribbon, Iraq Campaign Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign Medal and he threw that all away so that he could act like a f*cking Nazi. And even though his banner read,  YWNRU  (you will not replace us), he was certainly  replaced. Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.",News,"September 13, 2017"
 WATCH: Russian Politician Gloats On LIVE TV That Putin Stole Our Election,"Donald Trump may call anything related to his administration s collusion with Russia as FAKE NEWS, but you know who disagrees? Russia.Russian politician Vyacheslav Nikonov appeared on Sunday Evening with Vladimir Solovyov  where he shocked everyone by coming out and saying that, yes, Russia did steal the election. The U.S. overshot. Their intelligence services all slept through Russia electing the U.S. President,  Nikonov said, clearly shocking the host who seemed to have no idea how to respond (especially since the wrong response could have gotten him assassinated).  What kind of intelligence service is that? As we speak, Mueller s investigation of Donald Trump is heating up as The Donald s campaign is forced to turn over documents. Many Republicans speculate that he s  going for the kill. This is all very bad news for Trump, who has managed to bamboozle his Faithful into believing that the Russia investigation is a liberal lie designed to smear him   one in which the FAKE NEWS media is complicit.Watch Rachel Maddow report on the remarks below:?BREAKING VIDEO?

" Reporter Destroys Trump’s Homeland Security Advisor On Climate Change, This Is Brilliant (VIDEO)","The Trump administration has been getting absolutely pummeled for its refusal to acknowledge climate change, even as it becomes more obvious in our surroundings.On Monday, CNN s Jim Acosta tore Trump s Homeland Security advisor, Tom Bossert, apart in front of everyone for the administration s ignorance. Acknowledging the fact that several massive hurricanes have been ravaging the United States, Acosta cornered Bossert, asking him if Trump and his administration  saw a connection between climate change and homeland security and that the frequency and intensity of powerful storms like Harvey and Irma can pose a problem for future administrations  and if the storms were  giving the administration some pause when it comes to the issue of climate change and homeland security. Bossert was almost beside himself as he said: Causality s something outside of my ability to analyze right now. We continue to take seriously the climate change, not the cause of it, but the things that we observe. Then, Acosta nailed him and the entire Trump administration for their stupidity and ignorance: When you see three category 4 hurricanes all on the same map at the same time, does the thought occur to you,  Jeez, you know, maybe there is something to this climate change thing and its connection to powerful hurricanes?  Or do you just separate the two and say,  Boy, these are a lot of hurricanes coming our way? Bossert, nearly crumbling in front of the entire room of reporters, responded: There is a cyclical nature to the hurricane seasons and I thank the scientists for their forecast on this particular one. They were dead on that this would be a stronger and more powerful hurricane season with slightly more than average large storms making landfall  So we ll have to do a larger trend analysis at a later date. Trump s administration is being challenged by the obvious evidence for climate change, and now they re being called out for it. No one can ignore what is currently happening in our environment, and the enormous impact it will have if Trump s administration doesn t wake up.

 Never Forget: Donald Trump Bragged About Having The Tallest Building In Manhattan After 9/11,"I ll bet if you go to your kitchen and look at the calendar by your fridge, in tiny letters at the bottom of today s date it says  Patriot Day.  If not, don t worry   the official title for today s remembrance only began in 2002, the year after the terrorist attack that changed almost everything about the way our nation conducts itself. The word  patriot  means different things to different people, and we won t pretend to speak for them all here. But we know it when we see it, and we know the opposite of it, as well.Patriotism is what we see when we watched Americans coming together in grief and solidarity, helping each other in the aftermath of the attack. The opposite of it is what we saw when former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani politically invoked the attacks so much that Vice President Joe Biden once remarked that all Giuliani needed  to make a sentence is a noun, a verb, and 9/11.  Patriotism was on the face of our last President, holding a soup ladle in a national day of service in 2011. The opposite is what you call it when Rush Limbaugh attacked him and said he was  visiting the beneficiaries of his policies. Patriotism, in the words of Clarence Darrow,  hates injustice in its own land more than anywhere else. What it does not do is tout itself as superior. We see nothing but that from Donald Trump. When Trump lied on national television   one of more than a thousand times he s done so since his election   and said that he heard Muslims  cheering  the fall of the towers, perhaps what he was actually doing was projecting a little bit of his own guilt onto adherents of a religion he doesn t and has no desire to understand.Maybe, just maybe, Donald Trump felt a tiny bit bad for saying the worst thing anyone in America said on that fateful day in 2001: 40 Wall Street actually was the second-tallest building in downtown Manhattan, and it was actually, before the World Trade Center, was the tallest-and then, when they built the World Trade Center, it became known as the second-tallest. And now it s the tallest. What s at 40 Wall Street? The 71-story Trump Building.Listen here, if you can.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"September 11, 2017"
 WATCH: Black Driver Bravely Shames Cop Who Drew His Gun Over A Turn Signal Infraction,"When you are Black in America, getting pulled over by a cop   even for the smallest infraction   is a very scary thing. As we have seen repeatedly, this could cost you your life. Usually, when that happens, the cop in question faces no real consequences. Generally, the police department investigates itself and finds it did nothing wrong, naturally. So, to that end, Black Americans tend to act with extreme compliance when it comes to interactions with police. Not being that way could cost us our lives. However, one brave black driver who was pulled over for not using his turn signal properly decided that he s had enough, and confronted the cop who pulled him over and approached with a drawn gun.The whole incident was caught on video, as the man goes all in on the cop, saying: Big f*cking crime right? Big crime. A crime enough for you to come with your fucking gun pulled out, right? A turn signal not made is a big enough crime for you to need to take out your service pistol. Do you have no conscience? You just don t give a f*ck right? Because I would have been just another dead black motherf*cker right?  the man tells the officer.  And you would have just gone about your business, right? Luckily, the officer didn t shoot, and just accepted this rightfully outraged driver reading him the goods on his racist behavior. It s too bad more encounters with racist cops making unfounded assumptions about the supposed dangerous criminality of Black Americans can t end this way.Now, time to find out who this cop is.Watch the priceless video evidence of America s racist policing problem below:Cop pulls over a black man for failure to signal, walks to his car with his gun drawn  Black dude is my fucking hero????????????????????? pic.twitter.com/S8ef8Mx4Kk  SIX_FOOT_5 (@Choco_Optimus) September 10, 2017The ending of black dude going ham on cop  Left him looking stupid as fuck! ? pic.twitter.com/9oCHBbCBRi  SIX_FOOT_5 (@Choco_Optimus) September 10, 2017Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 10, 2017"
" Trump Junior TOTALLY Staged This Awkward Photo For The NYT, And Twitter Loves It","Last week, Donald Trump Junior became a new focus for Senate investigators in the case against Russia regarding the 2016 election. The New York Times did a piece on Wednesday detailing the fact that Junior was scheduled to  meet  with them (behind closed doors, of course) the following day and, well, you know the rest.It wasn t the article, explosive though it was, that captured the internet s attention, though. It was the hilariously badly-staged photo that Don Jr. apparently staged for Todd Heisler, a photographer on the Times  staff, and the image it was clearly trying   and failing miserably   to portray:I, too, casually arrange photographs of my 100 children to face outwards so I can only see the backs of frames pic.twitter.com/Pa0cHP5ayj  Ashley Feinberg (@ashleyfeinberg) September 8, 2017See the problem?

" New Study Proves That Trump Supporters Are Racist, Infuriated By Black People (IMAGE)","Despite the fact that Donald Trump and his fanbase try to convince everyone that they re not racist whenever they get called out, the verdict is in   and it s exactly as we suspected.Conservatives have been trying to convince everyone that their politics and values are about lowering taxes and minimizing big government, glossing over the fact that most of the time their policies will hurt minorities. Well, there s finally a proven reason for that   it s because, plain and simple, conservatives are racist as hell. And even worse, they have a particular fear of African Americans.In a study reported by Vox, Trump supporters can be set off just by looking at a picture of a black person, and just seeing one can significantly change how they feel about a policy. This was discovered thanks to a new study by political scientists at Colgate and the University of Minnesota, which shed light on some of Trump supporters  most racist behaviors.In the study, conservative participants were asked how they feel about housing assistance. The participants were divided in their support, however, when the researchers threw in a twist, it was discovered that Trump voters were WAY more likely to support housing assistance when they were shown an image of a white person. When they were shown a picture of a black person, it was a completely different story.And it gets worse   not only were the Trump supporters less supportive, but they actually became angry! Just by looking at an African American person, Trump supporters got mad. The authors of this study, which was called Supporters and Opponents of Donald Trump Respond Differently to Racial Cues: An Experimental Analysis,  wrote:We find that white Trump supporters randomly exposed to a black (versus a white) man in the context of soliciting their support for a housing-assistance policy were more opposed to the policy, angrier about the policy, and more likely to blame beneficiaries for their situation.So now we know that no matter how conservatives try to twist their justifications for not supporting certain causes that directly affect black people, the underlying issue is really that they re racist.Featured image via Mark Wallheiser  / Getty Images",News,"September 9, 2017"
 Another Pervert Out At Fox News Over Allegations Of Sexual Harassment,"Fox News has a problem with sexual predators in its ranks. Their gross corporate rape culture is costing them television personalities left and right. First, it was the now-deceased mastermind behind the network, Roger Ailes. Then it was Bill O Reilly (who was, by all accounts, their main star) who had to be canned to save the network s brand after millions were paid to his victims. Now, it is happening again   only this time it is Eric Bolling.Bolling had his own program, called The Specialists, which was relatively new, but he had been with the network for a decade. Fox News released a curt statement that read: Fox News Channel is canceling The Specialists, and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably. We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck. There was no mention of the sexual harassment charges, but that was clearly the reason. Bolling has been accused of sending lewd photos of penises to female Fox News employees. Bolling, for his part, is, of course, denying the allegations. His lawyer released a statement that reads: Mr. Bolling recalls no such inappropriate communications, does not believe he sent any such communications, and will vigorously pursue his legal remedies for any false and defamatory accusations that are made. This all comes on the heels of Bolling being suspended after Yashar Ali of the Huffington Post came out with an explosive report regarding Bolling s conduct in the workplace. Bolling is filing a $50 million lawsuit against Yashar for character defamation. It likely won t go anywhere as no one in their right mind would write such a story without concrete evidence.That network of right-wing propaganda needs to go down the toilet with the rest of the sewage. They are misogynistic, racist, and all around bigoted to their core. They are also pathological liars who should not be allowed to call themselves  news. So long, Bolling. Hopefully the rest of that vile network follows.Featured image via Logopedia",News,"September 8, 2017"
 Five ‘All American’ Football Players Booted From Team With Black QB After KKK Display,"The city of Creston, in the heart of Iowa, sits nestled between State Route 25 and U.S. Highway 34, only a mile from the eastern bank of Summit Lake. The seat of Union County offers two additional lakes to fish in, the glorious Green Valley State Park, and a high school football team full of terrifyingly virulent racists.At least, Creston had that last one until Thursday. Scheduled to play the Clarinda Cardinals Friday night, the Creston Panthers will suddenly find themselves without five of their starters after a viral photo of them wearing hoods and posing with a burning cross, a rifle, and a Confederate flag, made the rounds on social media earlier this week.Clearly, the players didn t do well in history at Creston High. The location of the school in Union County is a stark reminder of which side Iowans fought for in the Civil War.The boys will probably not face legal difficulties. Being a piece of shit KKK member, or even pretending to be one, is protected under the First Amendment, and in a town of fewer than 10,000, it s not likely there s a lawyer in town who could successfully argue that anyone suffered damages as a result of their racist idiocy. Not even Kylan Smallwood, the Panthers  quarterback, who is black. Sadly, Smallwood is already all too aware of the fact that this will blow over like nothing happened once the incident is forgotten. He won t forget, though: It s a bad way to put our town on the map, but I think as a community, we just have to move past it. Deal with it, I guess. I thought these guys were my friends. Like, I ve been to some of their houses before I wanted to ask them why, why they did it, but I haven t had the chance to yet. For their part, Creston High School has said that the students have been punished in addition to their removal from the team, but has not specified what that punishment was. Coach Brian Morrison called the families of each boy personally to tell them their sons were no longer playing for the Panthers.Just another day in post-racial America.Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 8, 2017"
 GOP ‘Moderate’ Under Attack From The Far Right Will Not Seek Re-election,"We recently reported on how the far right is waging war against a dying breed: Congressional Republicans who at least attempt to be compassionate and reasonable in their policy-making. At the top of the list for these far right lunatics  antics has been Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA), who is the co-chair of the moderate Tuesday Group in the House Republican conference. Dent has obviously been feeling the pressure from his less reasonable comrades, as he will not seek re-election in the 2018 midterms.This really isn t that surprising. Increasingly, the ultra conservative Freedom Caucus has gained power in the House Republican conference, and they and their followers have absolutely no problem ousting people who won t fall in line with their extreme far right agenda. It was this group that unseated former House Speaker Eric Cantor, and forced the most recent former House Speaker, John Boehner, to resign. So, perhaps Dent has the right idea here. He says of his decision: I ve worked to instill stability, certainty and predictability in Washington. I ve fought to fulfill the basic functions of government, like keeping the lights on and preventing default. Regrettably, that has not been easy given the disruptive outside influences that profit from increased polarization and ideological rigidity that leads to dysfunction, disorder and chaos. This, of course, is likely a nod toward those who are directly attacking and threatening Dent and other members of his Tuesday Group caucus. They see no way out when it comes to sustained political attacks by Trump minions and other nationalist types with alarming far right views.Now, as for how this helps us on the left? Den t district is a swing district. If we get our act together and run a good candidate in a good race. Get your act together, Democrats. As the GOP eats their own, these so-called  moderates  who aren t even bothering to run again out of fear of getting primaried by the far right can become Democratic seats. They are in swing districts, not solid red ones. The best way to #RESIST is to make sure we have a Democratic House of Representatives.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"September 8, 2017"
 Don Trump Jr. Testified To The Senate Today And They Don’t Seem To Believe A Word He Said,"Donald Trump, Jr. went before Congress today to give yet another version of his reasons for meeting with a Russian lawyer in June of 2016. While he did actually confirm what he said in the email string he was dumb enough to post to Twitter that he met with Natalia Veselnitskaya because she claimed to have dirt on Hillary he gave a ridiculous reason for it. His reason was that he was trying to determine Hillary s fitness for office, because that s a totally innocent reason that makes it all okay.So that makes it all innocent, especially because he also claimed that he was just so overwhelmed with the campaign due to inexperience, but he did still evidently have the presence of mind to know he should talk to legal counsel about the propriety of the meeting and info, or so his claim goes.Some, however, on the Senate Judiciary Committee don t believe him, it seems. Sen. Chris Coons, who sits on that committee, sent out a memo to  interested parties  about Don the Con Jr. and his testimony today, complete with the statute regarding giving false testimony to Congress. And there s no ambiguity about it   the top of the memo says: Below is a statute to keep in mind in regards to Donald Trump Jr. s testimony today. It quotes the full statute, which states that it s illegal to lie to Congress, and then Coons says: It is important to remember that anyone who testifies in front of a Senate committee is under the restrictions of the False Statements statute that says material false statements to Congress are criminal and punishable with fines or imprisonment or both. Read Coons  full memo below:? After Don Jr. testimony to Senate Judiciary Cmte, Sen. Chris Coons  office sends out statute on giving false statements to Congress pic.twitter.com/OUdKXMBfqm  Andrew Desiderio (@desiderioDC) September 7, 2017The many contradictions in Don Jr. s reasons for meeting with Veselnitskaya clearly raise doubts that his testimony today was the truth. He first claimed, months ago, that he didn t meet with any Russians, and then later claimed that meant he didn t meet with any known Russian officials. Then he claimed that he did meet with a Russian attorney, but it was about adoptions. After that, he said he did meet with her, but it was because he was told she had dirt on Hillary. He said the meeting was a fruitless endeavor.Now he says it s because he wanted to determine her fitness for the presidency, which he seems to think makes it all okay. Coons is right to be skeptical. It would be one thing if the junior Trump s story had never changed, and contradicting information had never come out. But it s impossible to trust the testimony of someone who s changed their story as many times as he has.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images",News,"September 7, 2017"
 BREAKING: Under Trump’s Leadership FEMA Could Run Out Of Money By Tomorrow,"After Hurricane Harvey devastated Houston, Texas, then Irma barreled through the Caribbean on its way to Florida, two Senate Florida Senators are warning that the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will run out of disaster assistance funding on Friday unless Congress approves more money.Republicans in the House had been looking at cutting almost $1 billion from disaster accounts to help finance Donald Trump s ego-wall on the Southern Border and now that a natural disaster occurred with another expected to hit Florida, the optics would look really bad for the GOP and for the former reality show star.Trump s budget includes slashing FEMA s budget:But the response to the next Harvey could face even stricter financial constraints if President Donald Trump gets his budgetary wishes for the 2018 fiscal year, which begins October 1. The president s budget blueprint calls for FEMA s budget for state and local grants to be cut by $667 million, saying that these grants are unauthorized or ineffective.However, after Hurricane Harvey unleashed its wrath with more storms coming, Senate Republicans agreed to more than double funding to $15.25 billion to FEMA and local block grants to handle natural disasters, according to Reuters. FEMA is stretched, and, of all things, FEMA runs out of money unless we act by tomorrow,  Democrat Senator Bill Nelson said during a speech on Thursday following a letter he wrote with Florida Republican Senator Marco Rubio to congressional leaders warning that more funds were necessary.FEMA had just over $1 billion on hand as of Tuesday, and that s less than half the $2.1 billion it had last week. We re not going to let money get in the way of saving lives,  FEMA director Brock Long told CBS on Wednesday.  Congress knows what they need to do. A Senate vote is planned later on today.On Wednesday, the House voted 419-3 to pass a $7.85 billion package to help victims of Hurricane Harvey.Reps. Justin Amash (Mich.), Thomas Massie (Ky.) and Andy Biggs (Ariz.) were the only lawmakers to oppose the aid.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.",News,"September 7, 2017"
" Florida Sheriff Exploits Desperate Hurricane Victims, Will Arrest Anyone With A Warrant Seeking Shelter","Ever since Donald Trump s rise, some of the most heartless people in positions of power have come out of the woodwork   likely because they are emboldened by Trump s being a heartless bastard from the bully pulpit of the White House. Case in point   Sheriff Grady Judd of Florida s Polk County.Of course, Florida is right in the middle of the path of the Category 5 beast known as Hurricane Irma. Therefore, there will be people in need of shelter and safety from the storm. However, instead of trying to help people stay alive during Irma, Sheriff Judd has reminded them that if they have any warrants out and they seek shelter, they will be arrested and taken to jail.  Hell, they even suggest that to make it easier, you should just turn yourself in to the jail instead! This was, of course, announced via Twitter:Here is a screenshot of the relevant tweets, via CNN s Twitter:Of course, this is incredibly dangerous. This man should be doing everything he can to protect the residents of the county he is sworn to serve and protect, not threatening them with jail time for seeking shelter from what could clearly be a very deadly storm. It s like this Sheriff wants people to be afraid to seek help, and ultimately wind up dying in a deadly hurricane. His actions are complete dereliction of duty, and he should be relieved of said duties.Of course, we all know that won t happen. What is more likely to happen is that more deaths occur than otherwise would have because people are too afraid to come forward for help.Featured image via CNN Twitter",News,"September 6, 2017"
 Trump Brags About Hurricane Size As Florida Braces For Disaster,"Donald Trump is apparently thrilled that Hurricane Irma will be the biggest storm to ever hit the United States.Only weeks after Hurricane Harvey left a swath of devastation and death in Texas, Florida is bracing for an even deadlier and more destructive storm.People will die. Businesses and homes will be wiped off the map. Suffering and homelessness will be the reality in Florida. But Trump is too busy bragging about the size of the hurricane to actually care about the people who are in the path of the storm.In yet another Twitter rant on Wednesday morning, Trump proclaimed that his team is already in Florida preparing for the storm after bragging about what a  good job  they have done in Texas.Watching Hurricane closely. My team, which has done, and is doing, such a good job in Texas, is already in Florida. No rest for the weary!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017In fact, Trump s response to Hurricane Harvey was to brag about the size of that storm, and he ended an Obama-era flood policy as Houston drowned. Trump has also proposed massive cuts to FEMA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which predicts and tracks hurricanes.It should also be noted that Trump inherited a FEMA that took the lessons of Hurricane Katrina seriously in preparation for future storms. So, Trump and his team did nothing special.But what Trump did next on Twitter shows just how little empathy and compassion he has for the people in the path of Hurricane Irma.Hurricane looks like largest ever recorded in the Atlantic!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2017Yeah, you read that right. Trump literally bragged about the size of this hurricane as if it s something to be proud of. This coming from a man who denies the very climate change that is causing bigger and more destructive hurricanes to form.As Floridians prepare for disaster, they must be wondering why Trump is so excited about watching them get slammed by the largest hurricane to ever strike the United States. If anything, Trump should be concerned about the coming destruction and death instead of bragging like he s about to win a prize.Featured Image: Jim Lo Scalzo   Pool/Getty Images",News,"September 6, 2017"
 Obama Pens STUNNING Response To Trump’s Cold-Blooded Move On DACA – Trump Fans Should Be Ashamed,"Trump is working his tail off to undo absolutely everything President Obama ever did, because the black man who once occupied the White House apparently hated all of America and everyone in it far more than His Royal Orangeness, and that includes ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. That program protects undocumented immigrants from deportation if they were brought into the country as children.That was one of Obama s more controversial executive orders, with Republicans all up and down the line calling it a gross overreach of executive power. But Trump s plan is more insidious than a belief that he s righting the wrongs of the previous administration. He promised to remove 11 million undocumented immigrants from the country, who (in his mind) are here because Obama and the Democrats favor open borders, and by golly, he s going to accomplish that even if it hurts innocent people.Like those protected by DACA.So Obama wrote an absolutely beautiful response to Trump s cold-blooded fuckery on Facebook, naming every single thing wrong with Trump s move, including that it is politically motivated and morally questionable. He also pointed out what should be obvious, but apparently isn t, to anyone who believes the GOP s lies: Kicking [these immigrants] out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. For eons, the GOP has been sending the message that undocumented immigrants are just one huge burden on us that we can t sustain. White, working-class Americans took that to mean that undocumented immigrants are one of the main reasons they re losing their jobs and can t make any headway in this economy.It s a matter of basic decency, according to Obama. He knows as well as the rest of us that Trump has no decency to him, because if he did, he wouldn t do this, let alone shirk his own responsibility for it by shifting it over to Congress: Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. The ending of it is a subtle jab at those who claim strict adherence to the Constitution s letters, but not its spirit, like all those allegedly  Constitutional  Republicans and conservatives who blasted Obama over DACA, and now stand with the Racist-in-Chief on this.

" WATCH: CNN Majorly F*cks Up, Has White Supremacist Weigh In On DACA Panel","Donald Trump is the first authoritarian president we have ever had. Of course, one of the hallmarks of autocrats is that they destabilize trust in the free press and eventually attempt to squash the Fourth Estate altogether. Trump has done a remarkable job of implementing this dangerous autocratic strategy with his base. Therefore, it is absolutely vital that news outlets make sure that everything they do is on the up and up. This is especially true of outlets that are favorite targets of Trump s such as CNN.Unfortunately, it seems that CNN is dropping the ball there in a major way. Case in point   they had a white supremacist sit on a nationally televised panel about the debate over whether or not the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program   otherwise known as DACA   should be rescinded by the Trump Administration.On Monday s edition of its early show, CNN had a panel discussion regarding the program that protects hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who were brought here through no fault of their own by their parents and know no other home. On the panel were Democratic strategist Maria Cordona, and Dan Stein of the Foundation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). However, there was one particularly disturbing detail that CNN left out of Stein s introduction: That his organization has a long history of trafficking in white supremacy. Luckily for the sake of public information, Think Progress s Judd Legum did it for them. Legum writes: CNN did not mention FAIR s deep roots in white supremacy, eugenics, and white nationalism. The organization was founded by John Tanton, who founded FAIR to keep America  a majority-white population. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center says of the founder of FAIR: [Tanton] has corresponded with Holocaust deniers, former Klan lawyers and the leading white nationalist thinkers of the era. He introduced key FAIR leaders to the president of the Pioneer Fund, a white supremacist group set up to encourage  race betterment,  at a 1997 meeting at a private club. He wrote a major funder to encourage her to read the work of a radical anti-Semitic professor   to  give you a new understanding of the Jewish outlook on life    and suggested that the entire FAIR board discuss the professor s theories on the Jews. Judd Legum goes on to say that Stein, said he believes America s immigration laws, which he regards as too permissive, are an effort  to retaliate against Anglo-Saxon dominance.  He said that the current generation of immigrants is engaged in  competitive breeding  and that  [m]any of them hate America, hate everything the United States stands for. As for Stein s contributions to the CNN panel on Monday morning? He insisted that DACA is nothing more than arbitrary amnesty program,  and said that Democrats should be forced to help the GOP secure the borders, build the wall, interior enforcement and cut chain migration  if they want to protect the DACA kids. In other words, make sure we keep America mostly white. No more brown people for this guy.Now, CNN has some great anchors. They really do. Personally, I try to tear myself away from MSNBC in order to watch them sometimes   particularly OutFront with Erin Burnett and The Lead with Jake Tapper. That being said, I have never been comfortable with their penchant for allowing Trump supporters to spew unchecked lies on the air. In this climate of deteriorating confidence in the Fourth Estate and confusion about what is and isn t true, these practices are hardly in the interest of the public good. Now, they have white supremacists as panelists, somehow believing that these views should be given mainstream legitimacy.Get your act together CNN. This is why I definitely prefer MSNBC.Watch this appalling discussion below:Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 4, 2017"
 Trump Administration Is Already Talking About Withholding Harvey Aid,"On the National Day of Prayer, Donald Trump lashed out at South Korea and North Korea, while his administration wants Congress to attach aid for victims of Hurricane Harvey to a bill that would increase the federal debt limit. So, Trump is now at war with an influential group of House conservatives who have warned GOP leaders not to connect the two funding initiatives. This move might cause a looming conservative uprising. Usually, with Republicans, they want a debt limit increase tied to spending cuts but now, with an entire city underwater and thousands in shelters and at least 45 dead, Conservatives will have to battle it out.On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that he and the former reality show star believe that raising the U.S. debt limit, which Congress must do within the next few weeks in order to avoid defaulting on its bills, should be tied to disaster relief funding for Hurricane Harvey. Without raising the debt limit I m not comfortable that we d get the money we d need this month to Texas,  Mnuchin said on  Fox News Sunday. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin revealed the administration s approach Sunday morning when he was asked whether the White House could guarantee that funding for the disaster would not be attached to the fight over the debt ceiling. No, I can t. Quite the contrary,  Mnuchin said, adding,  The president and I believe that it should be tied to the Harvey funding. Watch:NEW: Sec Mnuchin tells Chris Wallace on @FoxNewsSunday that if the debt limit isn't raised, it will interfere w/ the #Harvey relief effort. pic.twitter.com/EfxtOowH8C  Pat Ward (@WardDPatrick) September 3, 2017Mnuchin warned of a delay in recovery funding for Texas if the debt ceiling is not raised, according to the Washington Post. Our first priority is to make sure that the state gets money, it is critical, and to do that we need to make sure we raise the debt limit,  he said.  Without raising the debt limit, I m not comfortable that we will get the money that we need this month to Texas to rebuild. In 2011, congressional Republicans brought the country to the brink of default after refusing to raise the debt ceiling unless Democrats agreed to a series of future spending cuts. And now, Conservatives and Republicans will have to slap fight each other in order to get aid to Texas.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2017"
 Trump STUPIDLY Attacks A Major U.S. Ally Before Threatening North Korea With War,"If Donald Trump drags us into war with North Korea, it could be without the help of our most important ally in the region.South Korea is a critical ally since the country sits just below North Korea. South Korea not only serves as a base for our troops and any strike we launch against Kim Jong-Uu, it would provide logistical and military support.Defeating North Korea requires strong allies and cooperation. But Trump may have just ruined that with a Twitter tantrum on Sunday morning.First, Trump took a shot at China. Then he tweeted out what amounts to an  I told you so  and accused South Korea of appeasing North Korea. Then he threatened war with North Korea.North Korea has conducted a major Nuclear Test. Their words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States ..  Donald J.

And it s all because Donald Trump is a terrible leader who thinks being a bully works better than diplomacy and cooperation. Americans better get ready for nuclear war because Trump is going to start one.Featured image via Sean Rayford/Getty Images",News,"September 3, 2017"

 Psycho Cop Drags Handcuffed Nurse From Hospital For Not Letting Him Violate Patient’s Rights,"A power-tripping Salt Lake City cop was caught on video arresting a nurse for following hospital policy (and the law) by not allowing him to draw a blood sample from an unconscious patient without a warrant.In the video, Detective Jeff Payne can be seen confronting Alex Wubbels, an ER nurse, and then ultimately handcuffing her and dragging her out of the hospital.Payne was determined to get a blood sample from the patient, who had been involved in a car wreck that had taken the life of another driver. The only problem with this was that the patient was unconscious, so he there fore he could not give consent, and Payne didn t have a warrant.When Wubbels refused to allow Payne to draw the patient s blood, Payne argued with her and insisted that he indeed had the authority to take a blood sample without a warrant or the patient s consent. He also threatened to arrest her if she didn t allow him to violate the patient s rights. I either go away with blood in vials or body in tow,  Payne told the nurse.Wubbels consulted with multiple officials at University Hospital and then returned to tell Payne yet again that what if he wanted to take blood from an unconscious person, he would have to get a warrant.Payne, obviously furious, lost it at this point. He tells Wubbels that she is under arrest, grabs her arms and pulls them behind her back, then puts her in handcuffs. On the video, Payne can be seen dragging her out of the hospital and forcing her into the back of his police car. Help! Help! Somebody help me! Stop! Stop! I did nothing wrong!  Wubbels can be heard screaming.A University of Utah police officer and Department of Public Safety officers, who work as security officers for the hospital, were present but did not do anything to try to stop Payne from arresting the nurse for doing her job.After shoving Wubbels into the back of his car, Payne can be heard saying that from now on, when deciding which hospital patients will be transported to, he will keep this incident in mind. I ll bring them all the transients and take good patients elsewhere,  Payne said.Wubbels is being represented by Karra Porter, a Salt Lake City attorney, but she has not filed a lawsuit yet. According to Salt Lake police Sgt. Brandon Shearer, the department is conducting an internal investigation.According to Salt Lake police Sgt. Brandon Shearer, the department is conducting an internal investigation. Payne was suspended from the blood draw program but he still remains on duty. Shearer says that the department has conducted extra training as a result of this incident.Payne argued that  exigent circumstances and implied consent law  allowed him to draw blood from the unconscious patient. However, as Porter explained,  implied consent  hasn t been the law in the state of Utah since 2007 and in 2016 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against warrantless blood tests.Watch video of this out of control cop arresting a nurse for following the law, here: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"September 1, 2017"
 Trump’s Second Favorite Sheriff Just Very Suddenly Resigned,"Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke seems like he came right out of Donald Trump central casting. He s racist. He s so hard on alleged criminals that he even let some die in his jail cells. He is so committed to the idea of an Old West sheriff that he even wears a Stetson hat. Oh, and the icing on the cake is that Clarke is African-American, and to add a touch of bi-partisanship to Trump, Clarke is a Democrat (in all but words, deeds, and votes).He s a strong supporter of Donald Trump and he was allegedly under consideration for a cabinet position. Like Trump, Clarke is an authoritarian. While he s all for the militarization of law enforcement, his weapon of choice is old-fashioned intimidation and harassment, like he allegedly did toward an airline passenger who dared shake his head at the sheriff.Not surprisingly, Trump loves him, even though the whole job thing never panned out. Earlier in the week, Trump potentially violated ethics rules by tweeting a recommendation of Clarke s book.A great book by a great guy, highly recommended! https://t.co/3jbDDN8YmJ  Donald J.

YBM (@CommonSensai) August 31, 2017There are also rumors he s planning on running for a higher office.It s also highly likely that Clarke resigned because he s a sadist. Four people, including a baby, died in his jail cells within a one year period. One of the victims was mentally ill and he was deprived of water for a week. He died of dehydration.Despite being African-American, he seems to despise black people.Clarke, who grew up in a white neighborhood and attended a mostly white private high school, has said African Americans sell drugs  because they re uneducated, they re lazy, and they re morally bankrupt.  He calls Black Lives Matter  Black Lies Matter  and compared them to the KKK. He once claimed that  police brutality ended in the 1960s.  Clarke made an appearance in July at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where RNC delegates gave him a standing ovation as he proclaimed  Blue Lives Matter  and celebrated the acquittal of a Baltimore officer charged in the death of Freddie Gray.Source: Huffington PostGiven his history, I d say there s a better than even chance he s resigning in front of a looming scandal.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images",News,"August 31, 2017"
 W.H. Admits Trump Lied: Never ‘Witnessed Horror And Devastation’ Caused By Harvey ‘First Hand’,"Donald Trump claimed on Wednesday morning that he had  witnessed the horror and devastation  caused by Hurricane Harvey  first hand  during his visit to Texas earlier this week.After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey,my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 30, 2017But just like everything out that comes out of Trump s mouth, this turned out to be just another one of his lies. When White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was questioned about Trump s remark, she admitted that he was full of sh*t. He met with a number of local officials who are eating, sleeping, breathing the Harvey disaster,  Sanders said.  He talked extensively with the governor, who certainly is right in the midst of every bit of this, as well as the mayors from several of the local towns that were hit hardest. And detailed briefing information throughout the day yesterday talking to a lot of the people on the ground   that certain is a firsthand account. In truth, Trump never went anywhere near the hardest hit areas and never even met with a single victim of the hurricane. He visited Corpus Christi and gave a press conference with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, where he climbed on top of a fire truck to brag about the crowd size because that s what he does.The reality is that the closest Trump got to  witnessing first hand the horror and devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey  was looking at a radar map.After witnessing first hand the horror & devastation caused by Hurricane Harvey, my heart goes out even more so to the great people of Texas!A post shared by President Donald J.

 Dan Rather: Mueller’s Russia Investigation Has Trump ‘Seized With Fear’,"Legendary journalist Dan Rather says that Robert Mueller s ongoing Russia investigation has Donald Trump  seized with fear. Speaking to MSNBC on Wednesday, Rather explained that the investigation into Trump s possible collusion with Russia has Trump scared out of his mind. Donald Trump is afraid. He s trying to exude power and strength. He s afraid of something that Mueller and the prosecutors are going to find out. A political hurricane is out there at sea for him, we ll call it Hurricane Vladimir if you will, the whole Russian thing. It s still pretty far out at sea, but each day   this hurricane, this political hurricane   is building in intensity. Mueller s investigation has been steadily picking up steam. It was reported on Wednesday that New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is now working with Mueller to take an even deeper look at Trump s former campaign manager Paul Manafort.Former national security adviser Michael Flynn has also found himself under a microscope and has even tried to cut deals for immunity to flip on Trump. So far, neither Mueller nor Congress (who is conducting their own simultaneous investigation) has taken him up on the offer. This is presumably because they don t need to let Flynn off the hook in exchange for his testimony to nail Trump s hide to the wall.Publicly, Trump still claims that the investigation is nothing more than a  witch hunt.  However, those close to him say that behind closed doors, Trump has become increasingly distraught over the intensifying investigation into his shady Russian ties.Trump should be afraid, very afraid. In fact, being terrified of what Mueller may find is probably the smartest thing he has done so far. Sooner or later, the truth is going to come out just like it always does. And when that finally happens, Trump is going to be beyond screwed. It s only a matter of time.You can watch Rather s interview below: Featured image via video screen capture",News,"August 31, 2017"
 Trump ‘Really Likes’ The Idea Of A Violent Uprising When He’s Impeached,"According to Trump ally Alex Jones, when Donald Trump is impeached all bets are off. He won t tell his supporters to accept the decision of the American people. He won t urge calm. In fact, he quite enjoys the idea of a violent uprising in his name.Recently, TMZ approached Trump ally Roger Stone in an airport and asked about impeachment. This is not 1974,  Stone said.  People will not stand for [the impeachment of President Trump]. Any politician who votes for it would be endangering their own life. There will be violence on both sides. Stone clarified that a civil war  will happen  if The Donald is impeached. I was told the president really liked Roger Stone s clip on TMZ when they confronted him in an L.A. airport saying,  We re going to impeach Trump.'  Jones said during an interview with recently pardoned criminal Joe Arpaio after the former Maricopa County sheriff  said that  people who want to take me down better watch out. Trump has never exactly shied away from violence. In fact, when people oppose him at his rallies, he quite literally tells his meth-addled fascist followers to attack them. He has even offered to pay legal fees for supporters who brutally beat black men at his events.Unfortunately for Trump s supporters, a violent uprising will not go so well for them. While they view the Left as anti-gun, many of us are well-armed and (unlike them) properly trained to defend ourselves. We just don t worship our weapons like they do.Watch the interview below:Featured image via Gerry Images (Ralph Freso)",News,"August 30, 2017"
 Trump Confidante Confirms: The Donald Doesn’t Want To Be President Anymore,"Donald Trump is a horrible president. Everyone knew in the run up to the election that he was in no way qualified for this job. Now that he is in the Oval Office, these facts are magnified on an hourly basis a thousandfold. However, there seems to be one unlikely person who, at least secretly, shares these opinions in part: Donald Trump himself.A source close to Trump says that he is miserable. For one thing, he is angry that members of his cabinet, such as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, are refusing to walk in lockstep on some of Trump s more controversial public statements   the comments after the violent white supremacist rally in Charlottesville that left a woman dead is a particular source of Trump s ire. Further, what really seems to get him is that there will no firings of top level cabinet officials, because no qualified person would take those jobs now. The source says of how Trump is feeling on his cabinet secretaries  public thrashings: I think that cuts him to the quick. The same source says of the laughable idea of Trump being able to replace Tillerson or any other high level member of the cabinet: I couldn t name you a guy who would take the job or get confirmed. Also, the last of the alt-right   Trump s fellow travelers in bigotry   are pretty much gone from the White House, thanks to Trump s new Chief of Staff, General John Kelly. It seems that the disciplined adult in the room has zero intention of replacing literal Nazis like Trump s ousted Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon and key adviser Sebastion Gorka. The source says of these developments: General Kelly has come in and done a look-see on what everyone s been working on for the first six or seven months hereSome people were ready, and some people were not. As for Trump himself? Well, he s flippin  miserable. The source says of the poor old Donald s feelings as of late: He feels like this is not what he signed up for, and his accomplishments are being underplayed. He just looks around and says,  When is this going to get better? The source goes on to say that Trump s emotional state is  the worst it s ever been.  Well, what did he expect? Sure, when you re president, you re the most powerful person on earth. But it s also the hardest job in the world. It s hard even when the occupant is actually qualified. Trump is not. He has that attention span of a gnat on crystal meth, does not read books, can t even use basic modern technology such as email, has dangerous authoritarian instincts, no impulse control, and no respect for the rule of law. Further, he is bigoted, petulant, vindictive, and petty. He s also an admitted serial sexual assaulter and adulterer. In short   Trump is everything we DON T want in a president, from his character, to his knowledge (read: lack thereof), to his ignorance and bigotry.It seems that The Donald thought he d be able to rule over the nation like some kind of mad king. It s obvious that he got a very rude awakening. Oh, if only we lived in an alternate universe where he could have seen what this would be like, and had decided against running for president.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 30, 2017"
 Hypocrite Ivanka Gets SKEWERED For Approving Dad’s Move To Kill Obama Pay Equality Rules,"Ivanka Trump just proved that she doesn t support pay equality, and the Internet damned her to hell for her hypocrisy.During his presidency, President Obama issued a set of rules designed to help end pay discrimination on the basis of gender and race.The rules would have required employers to give pay data to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Such data would have been used as evidence of pay discrimination which could then be used to shape policies to end such practices.But Donald Trump killed those rules this week and excused his action by claiming that they violate the Paperwork Reduction Act. In short, Trump used a bullshit excuse to hurt women and minorities, and gave employers the power to discriminate at will.One would think that Ivanka Trump would be pissed about this, considering that she frequently claims to be a champion for equal pay. But, no.In fact, daddy s little girl actually backed her dad s decision. Ultimately, while I believe the intention was good and agree that pay transparency is important, the proposed policy would not yield the intended results,  Ivanka said.  We look forward to continuing to work with EEOC, OMB, Congress and all relevant stakeholders on robust policies aimed at eliminating the gender wage gap. Killing evidence-gathering rules actually kills the very transparency Trump claims is  important.

 That Time Mike Pence Begged Congress Not To Fund Hurricane Katrina Relief (VIDEO),"Hurricane Harvey devastated Texas on the 12th anniversary of Katrina. And now, Hurricane Harvey is advancing to Louisiana. Katrina was one of the five deadliest storms in United States history, killing nearly 2,000 people as flood walls failed and the levee broke. A whopping 80 percent of New Orleans was under water as people fought to get on their rooftops to survive. Katrina was the deadliest hurricane to hit the U.S. since 1928 and it took days before bodies were discovered, mostly the elderly and disabled.In 2005, Mike Pence, then a Republican congressman from Indiana, who considers himself to be a devout Christian, addressed the issue of funding for the devastated state. Mr. Speaker Katrina breaks my heart. When I consider it s tragic aftermath the ancient parable comes to mind  and the rains descended and the flood came and the winds blew and beat against the house and it fell with a great crash.  For most American families when a tree falls on your house, you tend to the wounded, you rebuild and then you figure out how you re gonna pay for it,  Pence said. Later today Congress will continue the work of funding the relief and recovery from Hurricane Katrina,  he continued.  And well we should by speeding more than $50 billion dollars to FEMA & other agencies, but as we tend to the wounded, as we begin to rebuild, let us also do what every other American family would do in like circumstances, and expects this Congress to do. Let s figure out how we re gonna pay for it. Congress must ensure that a catastrophe of this nature, does not become a catastrophe of debt for our children & grandchildren,  he added, unfortunately.Watch:Video:  Katrina breaks my heart but we must not let Katrina break the bank for our children & grandchildren  Mike Pence-2005 #ImpeachTrump pic.twitter.com/SxmT8NGEA7  Scott Dworkin (@funder) August 29, 2017At the time, Pence was leading an effort by House Republicans to offset any post-Katrina aid with offsetting budget cuts in other programs, which includes highway projects and the new Medicare prescription drug benefit.Mike, you can stop calling yourself  pro-life  now, thankyouverymuch.Featured image via Aaron P.

 Ted Cruz Awkwardly Explains Why Texas Should Have Federal Relief Money But Not Victims Of Hurricane Sandy,"U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz was against federal aid for natural disasters until he was for it. The Texas Senator voted against Federal funding for victims of Hurricane Sandy, the deadliest and most destructive hurricane in the Atlantic in 2012, but now he wants funds after Hurricane Harvey barreled down on his state. At least 14 people have died after Harvey hit Texas. More than 3,000 people have been rescued as responders work around the clock in devastating conditions.During a press conference on Monday, Cruz said that Trump has pledged  whatever the state needs  for water-soaked Texas. But, just after that presser, Cruz was in the awkward position of having to defend his position to MSNBC s Katy Tur on the 2012 Hurricane Sandy relief package, calling it  filled with unrelated pork. There is time for political sniping later,  Cruz said without one bit of irony or acknowledgement of his hypocrisy. It s not really political sniping, senator,  Tur shot back.  These are people who needed money and who needed funding right after that storm, I covered those people. Many of them, just like those in Houston, lost absolutely everything they owned. Cruz told Tur that hurricane relief is a  vital, central role  of the federal government and should continue to be for a long time. The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork,  Cruz said. Two-thirds of that bill had nothing to do with Sandy,  he continued.  And what I said then and still believe now is that it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster and people who are hurting to pay for their own political wish list. Disaster relief needs to be focused on the victims of disaster relief, and I supported that for Sandy, disaster relief there, and I would support that anywhere there s a major disaster without getting distracted by political, unnecessary pork spending,  he added.The Washington Post begs to differ with Cruz:The Congressional Research Service issued a comprehensive report on the provisions, and it s clear that virtually all of it was related to the damage caused by Sandy. There may have been some pork in an earlier Senate version, but many of those items were removed before final passage. There were also some items that appear to have been misunderstood.Regardless, Ted Cruz voted against it but now he wants all that delicious disaster relief money for his state. And, Texas should get that money asap. The victims of Sandy should have, too.Image via screen capture. ",News,"August 29, 2017"
 The UNBELIEVABLE Reason Trump Pardoned Arpaio As Hurricane Harvey Was Bearing Down,"If Donald Trump hadn t proven himself to be the worst person to ever occupy the White House, he certainly proved it on Friday. While Hurricane Harvey was about to hit land as the largest hurricane in over a decade, he pardoned the racist sheriff Joe Arpaio.As it turns out, Trump s timing wasn t just heartless and it wasn t at all oblivious. Like nearly everything the former reality show star does, it was about television ratings. In the middle of a hurricane, even though it was a Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally,  Trump said during a press conference with Finnish President Sauli Niinist .  You know, the hurricane was just starting. He s done a great job for the people of Arizona, he s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration,  Trump said about Arpaio.  I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started. Source: The HillBy pardoning the man who was convicted of disregarding a court order to stop racially profiling, Trump already proved himself to have zero compassion, but the fact that it was some sort of ratings grab proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Trump isn t even human.It also explains a lot about his media coverage during the election. Trump seems to have one skill, and that is to bring on ratings, in much the same way as any shock jock might. He doesn t elevate the national dialogue; he shoves it into the gutter. He will never be my president because he refuses to be my president. He is only the president to those who voted for him. He is by far the most divisive man (and I use that word very broadly) to ever hold office. He is id with a dangerous dose of ego and Friday s pardon of Arpaio showed the worst of both.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"August 28, 2017"
 Donald Trump Was Looking To Build A Trump Tower In Moscow While He Was Running For President,"As you would be more than aware, contacts between high-ranking and lower-level Trump aides and Russians have emerged in recent months and, as a result of these talks, a new story is coming to light; that Donald Trump s businesses were trying to seal a deal on building an enormous Trump Tower in Moscow while he was campaigning to become President of the United States.According to those familiar with the proposal, as well as new records reviewed by Trump Organization lawyers, Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer who migrated to Brooklyn at the age of six, was essentially begging Trump to fly to Russia to promote the idea for the Tower and also claimed he could get President Vladimir Putin to say  great things  about Trump, all while he was still campaigning to be Commander in Chief in late 2015 and early 2016.Sater took it to another level when he predicted in an email sent to Trump Organization Executive Vice President Michael Cohen in November 2015, that Trump and his organization would be celebrating both his Presidential win and one of the biggest residential projects in the history of real estate. According to one of the few people briefed on the email exchange, Sater s message to Cohen was something to the effect of,  Can you believe two guys from Brooklyn are going to elect a president? The plan for the Moscow Trump Tower was abandoned at the end of January last year, just before the beginning of the presidential primaries and before Trump s Russian business ties became a major issue, because, although the Trump Organization signed a letter of intent to go ahead with the project despite Trump himself not making the proposed trip to Russia, they lacked the land permits to proceed.The details of the Moscow Trump Tower have deal have never been made public, however, the emails are scheduled to be turned over to congressional investigators soon and all signs point to this being far from President Trump s only business dealing with Russia during his time on the campaign trail. White House officials, as well as Cohen, Trump s longtime legal advisor, have declined to comment on the issue.Featured image via Michael Reynolds   Pool/Getty Images",News,"August 28, 2017"
 Eric Holder Just Hilariously Called Trump Out On Arpaio: Obama Never Asked Me To Drop A Case,"Former Attorney General Eric Holder responded to a report that Donald Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions to drop the charges against Joe Arpaio (aka America s most racist sheriff) by throwing shade at the crooked administration on Twitter.The Washington Post published an article on Saturday claiming that Trump had personally asked Sessions to abandon the case against Arpaio, who was convicted of criminal contempt charges after ignoring a federal court order. Holder tweeted out that in all the years he had worked as Attorney General under former President Obama, he had never once been asked to drop charges against anybody, ever. Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO,  Holder tweeted on Sunday, with a link to the article written by the Post included.Number of times over six years that President Obama called and asked me to think about dropping a case: ZERO https://t.co/je7dhk7R28  Eric Holder (@EricHolder) August 27, 2017According to the Post, Trump s advisers told him that asking Sessions to drop the Arpaio case would be a mistake but naturally, he did it anyway. When the charges against Arpaio moved forward, Trump decided that it didn t matter because he was just going to pardon him if he was convicted anyway. What are friends for? Right?Arpaio was convicted of criminal contempt charges after a federal court ordered him to stop the racist policing practices he employed as sheriff of Maricopa County, which included jailing suspected illegal immigrants in a  tent city.  Despite the court s ruling that his practices were discriminatory and violated the Constitution, Arpaio basically gave a middle finger to the judge and continued his bigoted tactics.Trump pardoned his loyal supporter on Friday night while the nation was being ravaged by Hurricane Harvey. He was promptly condemned for this move by both Democrats and Republicans alike. Even House Speaker Paul Ryan spoke out against Trump s decision to pardon Arpaio on Saturday.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images",News,"August 27, 2017"
 Phoenix Newspaper Breaks The Internet In Brutal Tweetstorm On Former Sheriff Joe Arpaio,"A Phoenix publication took to its Twitter account to explain the kind of person former Sheriff Joe Arpaio is following Donald Trump s decision to pardon him. The former reality show star pardoned the racist former Sheriff of Maricopa County while a hurricane was barreling down on Texas. Trump is likely testing his pardoning powers to use that same privilege for the Russia investigation.Joe Arpaio called himself  America s toughest sheriff,  but appeared to be begging for a pardon after he was convicted of criminal contempt in July after violating a 2011 court order in a racial profiling case. Arpaio, 85, was ordered to stop profiling Latinos but he couldn t stop himself.Trump tweeted,  I am pleased to inform you that I have just granted a full Pardon to 85 year old American patriot Sheriff Joe Arpaio. He kept Arizona safe!  but the Phoenix New Times which has covered Arpaio for two decades reminded everyone that the former sheriff is no patriot.We've been covering Joe Arpaio for more than 20 years.

" Trump Calls Out Anti-Fascists By Name, But FBI And DHS Say The Alt-Right Acts Like ISIS — And Goes Unmentioned","Ever since the Nazi rally in Charlottesville, Virginia claimed the life of Heather Heyer, the entire spectrum on the Right   from moderates all the way to Alt-Right terrorists   has been scrambling to figure out a way to blame it on the Left. That s natural. It was a murder, after all. Nobody wants to take the blame for anything bad they re responsible for, let alone the murder of an innocent victim. But Donald Trump has been especially adept at seemingly calling out radical groups, while never actually explicitly naming the radical group that is to blame.It s not like he doesn t know the phrase  Alt-Right.  It s in the news every day. He sure as hell knows the word  Antifa.  That s the  many  in his  many sides  comment after Heyer s murder, which he doubled down on two days later. In fact, the word came out of his mouth in accusation at his Phoenix rally last Tuesday. Someone even made a joke about it: pic.twitter.com/9fANLcaXXN  Chris Stephens (@ChrisStephensMD) August 23, 2017The only time I can remember Trump saying the words  alt-right  in reference to Charlottesville was in Trump Tower: What about the  alt-left  that came charging at, as you say, the  alt-right ? Do they have any semblance of guilt? As YOU say.So why won t he address the Alt-Right? They are a terrorist group, by any definition. What s more, they identify as Christians, persecuted for their identity, justifying their actions with appeals to  us  over  them.  That s pretty reminiscent of another radicalized, religious extremist group that feels persecuted, hates outsiders and gay people, treats women like chattel, and uses terror and death to achieve their aims.Only those guys are brown.Here in America, though, ISIS and groups like them   that is to say,  radical Islamic terrorists    have nothing on white Christian males. A joint intelligence bulletin from the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security found that the group we softly label  white supremacists  were responsible for 49 murders in 26 terror attacks over the last decade and a half. That s more than any other group in America. That report from two agencies tasked with American safety literally says that radicalized white Christian males are the most dangerous people in the country.Part of Trump s unwillingness to name the Alt-Right as the terror group they are comes from their Goebbels-like effectiveness with propaganda. If they can make it seem like there actually are two  sides  to the conflict that led to Heyer s death (and countless other injuries, physical, mental, and personal), they can paint their own side as justified in opposition to it. They achieve this with troll-led petitions that seem legitimate, and by posing as members of the Left and doing horrible things. Remember that kid who would break something, then leave a piece of it in his brother s room so his parents would bust the wrong boy? That s the Alt-Right.But the other part of Donald Trump s inability to name names when it comes to the Alt-Right is simple: They are his biggest fans, and he loves them, terrorism be damned.Featured image via Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",News,"August 26, 2017"
" One More Nazi Resigned From Trump’s White, House; Will Newly Pardoned Arpaio Replace Him?","Just days after Donald Trump advisor and avowed racist alt-right provocateur Steve Bannon was fired, another of Trump s White House Nazis is out.Sebastian Gorka was born in London but lived in Hungary where he worked with racist and anti-semitic groups. He resigned on Friday because Trump apparently hasn t been effective enough in Making America Great White Again. [G]iven recent events, it is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are   for now   ascendant within the White House,  Gorka reportedly wrote in a letter obtained by The Federalist. CNN confirmed the letter. As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People s House,  he continued. Gorka was seen as one of Trump s staunchest supporters, and often took to TV to rip the media s coverage of the administration.Source: The HillGorka is best known as one of Trump s spokespeople who creeps the hell out of people. Watch Samantha Bee tell you everything you need to know:Donald Trump s White House has had quite the day. He banned transgender people from the military. A Category Four hurricane is about to hit Texas, so Trump loosened regulations on federal flooding standards.In a week when Trump is challenged to prove to the nation that he s not racist, he pardoned Maricopa, Arizona former Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was convicted of violating a court order to stop racially profiling people. Will Arpaio take Gorka s place?Why not? Trump clearly doesn t care if he s perceived as a racist. That s his base. In his surreal and overly defensive speech he gave in Phoenix this week, he once again brought up the border wall, an issue that Arpaio deeply cares about. Arpaio has long been a supporter of Trump and he s proven that he s willing to thwart the law, just like Trump.Trump and Arpaio aren t new to partnering. Arpaio assigned a fake posse to help in Trump s fake search for President Obama s real birth certificate.Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio would assign a five-man  Cold Case Posse  to probe the authenticity of Obama s birth certificate, he told Jerome Corsi, the former World Net Daily columnist and Ur-birther.  When I get allegations brought to me by the citizens of Maricopa County, I look into the allegations, just like I am doing here,  he said at the time.Six months later, Arpaio announced at a press conference that the long-form birth certificate was a  computer-generated forgery.  That s when Trump took notice. Within a couple weeks of Arpaio s announcement, Trump had printed out an Associated Press article about the charade and handwritten a note to the sheriff. It read:Joe Great going you are the only one with the guts to do this keep up the good fight. Donald TrumpSource: NY MagIn other words, look for Arpaio to be Trump s next hire.

" On The Day A Hurricane Is About To Hit Land, Trump Signs Order Making Floods Worse","Donald Trump is about to get his first real test as Commander-in-Chief. Hurricane Harvey is a Category four storm that s about to hit landfall in Texas. It will be the worst since Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and on the very same day it s set to hit he s going to sign an executive order that will potentially make future hurricane damage much worse.Trump s executive order is just another petulant attempt at undoing everything Obama did because well he was Obama. It would reverse standards that would make government buildings safer from flooding   something needed with rising sea levels, and yes, with hurricanes.The Trump administration has complained that it takes too much time to get permits and approvals for construction projects. The administration has issued dozens of rules and orders to reverse or rescind Obama-era regulations addressing climate change and its consequences such as rising sea levels and more severe storms.The Obama-era standard required that builders factor in scientific projections for how climate change could affect flooding in a certain area and ensure projects can withstand rising sea levels and stronger downpours.Source: CNBCThe scientific consensus is that sea levels are going to rise at an alarming level. By the end of the century, they could rise by more than six feet. While that may not sound like a lot, think about the havoc on your own home when there are just a few inches of flood water.Obviously, this executive order only affects federal buildings and state regulations could easily override them, but many of the states in the flood zones (like Texas, Louisiana, the Carolinas, Georgia and Florida) are led by, and overwhelmingly inhabited by, Republican climate change deniers. Washington, D.C. is also in a flood zone.Trump sees safety regulations on buildings as an inconvenience for him. Overturning Obama s executive order does two things, it helps erase the black guy s legacy and it helps the Grifter-in-Chief just in case he gets a federal contract.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images.",News,"August 25, 2017"
 RNC Staffer Assigned To Finding Positive Stories About Trump Says Take This Job And Shove It,"Imagine for a moment that your job was to scour the media, searching for the rare news report that puts a positive spin on Donald Trump and his disastrous escapades in the White House. For one RNC staffer, this was the day to day reality he faced every morning when he clocked into work. After hanging on for several months, Andy Hemming finally decided he couldn t take it any longer and resigned. You can hardly blame the guy and have to ask, how did he stay on this sinking ship as long as he did?According to Politico, Hemming handed in his resignation on Monday. Previously, the publication had written a profile on Hemming which referred to him as the staffer the White House pays  $89,000 a year to spot and distribute positive stories from the mainstream media. Hemming was senior adviser for research at the RNC in the 2016 cycle and director of research on the Trump campaign. At the White House, he worked from 5:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. every weekday and was a regular in reporters  inboxes, blasting out stories favorable to the administration.Hemming has not yet commented on his decision to leave the position, but White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that it was a  [m]utual decision that he could best help promote the president s agenda on the outside. Andy is smart and very talented and we wish him all the best. All administrations have people dedicated to finding and spreading news stories that show the president in a good light, but performing these duties with Trump at the helm was no doubt a unique experience. There surely isn t much positive media coverage on him these days because, in addition to being a raging bigot, he continually manages to screw up even the simplest of tasks (like not frying his retinas while watching the eclipse). How Hemming kept from completely losing his mind long before now is anybody s guess.Featured image via Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2017"
" Trump Wants It Both Ways, But You Can’t Pass The Most Bills If ‘They’ Won’t Let You Pass Bills","Everybody s gotten used to Donald Trump contradicting himself. You can almost count on it, really. But with the exception of a few notable misspellings and typos, generally, his tweets that contradict previous tweets don t come on the same day, let alone in the same hour. And a contradictory pair in the span of eleven minutes? Maybe he s reprising another guy s role.Friday morning, Trump did just that. He complains all the time, but the two complaints that he tweeted just after 6:30 his time just don t go together. First, he says that 8 Democrats  control  the Senate because of the filibuster. Trump has advocated that the GOP use the nuclear option to get rid of the filibuster for some time, but most if not all Republicans are hesitant   they know that if they do, the next time voters elect a Democratic majority, their opposition will be able to ram through any legislation they like, with nothing to stop them. That s something Trump doesn t understand neither party wants.If Senate Republicans don't get rid of the Filibuster Rule and go to a 51% majority, few bills will be passed. 8 Dems control the Senate!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 25, 2017Just eleven minutes later, Trump came to his senses and realized if he says the GOP can t pass bills   and he is the leader of the GOP   then he can t keep saying he s passed more bills than a concert promoter on a New York subway. So he went back to that.Few, if any, Administrations have done more in just 7 months than the Trump A. Bills passed, regulations killed, border, military, ISIS, SC!  Donald J.

The point is, Trump really wants to have it both ways   that he simultaneously is the most bestest at presidenting, and that those dirty demon-dog Democrats won t let him president properly.

He s behind Bill Clinton in bills passed and signed by about 30% for this point in his presidency.And that s just fine by me.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images",News,"August 25, 2017"
" In The War Against ISIS, Trump Is Already Responsible For More Civilian Deaths Than Obama","I will confess: I belong to a faction of the left that hates war in any context. I turned 15 during the brief skirmish known as Operation Desert Shield, and even then, I wasn t skipping school to go to the mall. I was spray painting anti-war slogans on every concrete surface in my little town I could get away with.Okay, I was going to the mall too.That last part is important because what I mean to convey is that while I have always opposed war in every way, I was also a pretty realistic kid. Even then, I understood that my complaints lodged in Krylon  on the side of a bridge were mostly meaningless. In that context, I approach The Left who are even further to the left than me: Yes, we are embroiled in the longest war in the history of the United States in Afghanistan. Yes, we are  fighting  an invisible War On Terror. Yes, I hate those things. I also understand that the complaints I now lodge in Facebook posts, tweets, and these articles are like colored mists on the bridges and walls of war.In the end, the fury of war can only be mitigated by absolutely minimizing the innocent victims of it. But how can that be accomplished in a war against ISIS, an enemy that recruits civilians, uses them as human shields and otherwise disregards humanity in the name of jihad?There are those on the left that condemn President Barack Obama for increasing the number of drone strikes initiated by the United States in the Middle East and South Asia. And those on the right simply condemn him for existing. So I will stand with whoever has identified with me so far here and give credit to our 44th President for mitigating the level of civilian deaths in those ongoing wars using tactical precision.I like to think that Barack Obama opposes war in the way that I do: Absolutely, but if it is happening, it must be done in a way that keeps the most civilians safe.By contrast, Donald Trump does not understand war. He certainly does not oppose it. I believe that he sees it only in the abstract: An ongoing effort to  win  at all costs, like everything in his life. Almost like war is a jacket and hat you put on for the cameras.The numbers bear this theory out. According to Airwars, a UK-based  transparency project  that has tracked the number of civilians killed since the US-led coalition formed in October 2014 to combat ISIS, there is a disparity between Obama s direction and Trump s that cannot be reconciled any other way:Our minimum estimate of civilians likely killed by Coalition since 2014 is now 5,117   with 55% of deaths occuring under Trump's leadership pic.twitter.com/H8S5Ihwuzb  Airwars (@airwars) August 22, 2017During @BarackObama's 29 months at helm of ISIS war we tracked 855 alleged civilian casualty events which likely killed 2298-3398 civilians pic.twitter.com/RUVvcy5zX9  Airwars (@airwars) August 22, 2017In @realDonaldTrump's first 7 months as President, we tracked 1,196 alleged incidents in which we assess at least 2,819-4,529 civilians died pic.twitter.com/pnCzVR5ggb  Airwars (@airwars) August 22, 2017Civilian deaths in war cannot be avoided. That is a simple fact. But even if you go back to the New York Times link I provided above ( the number of drone strikes ), you can see that precision can mitigate them. Bush ordered 50 drone strikes which killed 296 terrorists and 195 civilians   a 40% civilian casualty rate. Under Obama, the strikes went up, but the casualty rate went down: Ten times as many strikes, more than ten times as many dead terrorists, but less than twice as many civilian casualties. Just over 11%, at the time of that report.Like his presidency, Trump s war is messy. More than half of all civilian deaths in the war against ISIS have occurred in the 7 months since Donald Trump was inaugurated.That s not opposition. That is an embrace of war.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2017"
 Want To Ride On Air Force One As A Senator? Then Be Prepared To Vote For Trump’s Health Care Bill,"By now we re all familiar with Donald Trump s speech in front of 40,000 boy scouts at their National Jamboree last month, when the President rambled like a drunken stepfather, straying from the usual topics of diplomacy and citizenship and turning an 80-year presidential tradition into a campaign rally before a crowd of adolescents. But the madness didn t stop there.According to reports, White House aides told Republican Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, host state of this year s quadrennial Boy Scouts of America National Jamboree, that she could fly with him on Air Force One when he addressed the boy scouts, but only on one condition; that she vote in favor of Senate Republicans  healthcare bill. At the time the offer was made to Capito, Republicans were clutching at straws and doing anything possible to salvage their overhaul in the Senate in an effort to actually try and come through on one of the main promises Donald Trump made the entire time he was on the campaign trail, to repeal and replace  the disaster that is Obamacare. Naturally, Capito took the high road and turned down the offer, mainly due to the fact that she hadn t even read the actual text of the bill at the time, however, Capito was also one of several Republicans senators who had made their doubts clear about it in the first place.There were several versions of the plan that failed so the Republicans ultimately threw together a  skinny repeal,  but that also failed when 49 voted for it while 51 voted against, with Arizona Senator John McCain casting the deciding negative vote. Capito also voted against the Republican s skinny repeal, sending them back to the drawing board.President Trump still vows to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act and is adamant that he will get his bill passed, however, it may take a little more than a ride on Air Force One to get the votes.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"August 23, 2017"
 All Hell Breaks Loose At First Charlottesville City Council Meeting Since Nazi Rally,"All hell broke loose on Monday when the city of Charlottesville held their first city council meeting since torch-wielding white supremacists took over the small Virginia town, leaving a counter-protester dead in their wake. Residents were more than ready to let the city council know just how they felt about the city allowing Nazis to march through their streets. You had multiple opportunities to intervene and you did not intervene one time.  We told you exactly what you needed to do and you did nothing,  one man told the city council members at the meeting.Two protesters who were holding a sign that read  Blood on your hands  climbed up on top of the dais, at which point several members of the city council got scared and ran away. Police eventually removed several people from the meeting and arrested at least three of them, which prompted the crowd to chant Shame  and  Shut it down. Vice Mayor Wes Bellamy, was the only official who had the guts to stay and try to negotiate with the protesters, who have every right to be pissed off that Nazis were given a permit to spread their hate and violence throughout Charlottesville. The protesters called for Mayor Mike Signer to resign from his position, chanting  Signer must go! After making it abundantly clear that they do not appreciate the city council inviting white supremacists to town, they also demanded the removal of Confederate monuments from Charlottesville. The city agreed to begin the removal process and a motion was approved by the council that will commemorate the victims of the Nazi rally by draping black fabric over the statues.Watch more on the mayhem here, via WVIR: NBC29 WVIR Charlottesville, VA News, Sports and WeatherFeatured image via video screen capture",News,"August 22, 2017"

 Trump Told More Than A Thousand Documented Lies In Only Seven Months (DETAILS),"What would you do if someone kept track of everything you ever said? Most of us aren t in a position to have their every utterance monitored, but if we were, we might actually, you know, watch what we said. Especially if we knew that the people keeping track were specifically looking for lies, backtracking, flip-flopping, and repetition of all of the above.As soon as someone runs for President, however, they have to know that at the very least the media will be tracking their statements. Which means two things: Donald Trump doesn t give a shit about telling the truth, and he knows that his supporters will always think he s telling the truth, no matter how ridiculous his statements are.That s the only conclusion I can draw from Tuesday s Washington Post article, in which the running tally of lies has now surpassed a thousand in these first seven months of Trump s presidency.Many of Trump s prevarications can be chalked up to repeating debunked claims   the logic, of course, being that even if the president didn t know a thing wasn t true the first time he said it, if it s completely debunked and he repeats it, he s lying. And lying in and of itself speaks volumes to Donald Trump s character. But the kinds of lies he tells almost say more about who he is than the simple fact that he tells them.Take for example his many claims of accomplishments: The long and short of it is, he has none. When he touts the economy or jobs or the stock market, not only is he claiming responsibility for things that have nothing to do with his policies, but he s flip-flopping on his prior opinions that those things were in a  bubble  under the last president. When he says he s  bringing back jobs,  he often cites Wal-Mart, or Ford, or ExxonMobil, among others   all companies whose plans for expansion predate Trump s inauguration.Some of the lies are more nefarious in nature. It is well-documented that there is no evidence of voter fraud or widespread voting by undocumented immigrants, yet he continues to make the claim. It is indisputably untrue that Hillary Clinton was in any way responsible for a uranium extraction deal with Russia that gave the hostile country a significant stake in US rights. Why is it untrue? Because Hillary Clinton has never been president. Why Donald Trump or his supporters are stupid enough to think a Cabinet member can unilaterally negotiate with a foreign country over US interests is baffling. Does Trump think Rex Tillerson has the power to sell our oil drilling rights to Russia without his approval?The article puts the current number of Trump s lies at 1,057, notwithstanding any tweets from today, of course. In 214 days, 1,057 lies is an average of 4.94 lies per day. By this time next year, if his average holds, Trump will have lied to America nearly three thousand times.But will his supporters care?Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images",News,"August 22, 2017"
 Stormfront Founder’s Son Sounds Alarm About Trump And Nazis: ‘He Salvaged Their Message’,"White supremacists have been emboldened by Donald Trump from the moment he came down the escalator in Trump Tower and announced his bid for the White House by branding all immigrants of Mexican descent rapists and criminals. That travesty of a campaign continued in that vein, as has this sorry excuse of a  presidency.  Trump knows that these people think they have a friend in him (and they do, honestly), so he refuses to disavow them.The latest debacle in that direction is, of course, Trump s disgraceful equivocation between neo-Nazis and their counter protesters during the violent white nationalist gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia. Of course, that gathering claimed the life of Heather Heyer, a brave activist standing up against hate.After Trump s remarks, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke was alight with praise. It turns out there s a reason for that, and it is much more sinister than those of us who are not within the white power movement to really comprehend. There is one person who does, though: Derek Black, a former white nationalist and the son of Don Black, the founder of the infamous neo-Nazi website Stormfront.The younger Black warns that Trump s heightened flirtation with Nazis and his legitimizing of their message via equivocation with counter protesters is really making things much worse. At first, the white nationalists  message wasn t getting out due to the news being focused on all of the violence. According to Black, though, that all changed with Trump. Speaking to New York Times writer Michael Barbaro, Black said of Trump s response to Charlottesville: He salvaged their message. The message that they were trying to get out was that tearing down Robert E Lee s statue is an assault on white culture, so if you think that tearing down REL s statue is the wrong choice then these are your guys. But then amidst all the violence and the chaos, I think that got lost   you re not going to follow those people even if you believe that. But then in [Trump s] message, saying these are good people because they re fighting for something that a lot of people believe in, he salvaged the message that they wanted to spread, which is that if you believe this too and maybe you re on the edge about whether this is a fringe movement or not, Donald Trump thinks we re fine. And that is just yet. It is why they are wearing khakis and polos now instead of hoods. It is why they are re-branding themselves the so-called  alt-right.  It is why they are even telling people who come to their rallies to look  sexy    so that they can disassociate from uneducated, mouthbreathing rednecks who everyone mocks and no one takes seriously. They want to make sure this is someone who could be your cookie cutter suburban family, just living next door, and you d be none the wiser. That s why it is so important to keep this a fringe group in the minds of everyone, regardless of whether their politics are left-wing or right-wing. Black further explains: It s just impossible to say what will happen in the future. Maybe nothing. But the point of that rally was to try to recruit people, to try to grow. And if you were on the fence about whether you should get involved in that stuff or not, the president s OK is the biggest thing that s ever happened. That s why what Trump is doing here is so dangerous. It s why we all need to MAKE SURE that white supremacy, no matter how it is dressed up, is NEVER normalized. Ever. That will be the job of all of us, because clearly, that messaging will never come from the White House.Thank you, Derek Black, for denouncing your family s hateful beliefs, and speaking out in a unique way to counter this kind of hate.Featured image via Twitter",News,"August 22, 2017"
 Congressional Black Caucus Signals That They Absolutely Intend To Impeach Trump,"The Congressional Black Caucus, like most Democrats and reasonable people everywhere, have never had very warm feelings toward Donald Trump   to put it mildly. After all, this is a section of the House of Representatives dedicated to protecting the interests and rights of Black Americans, and Trump is a lifelong open and avowed racist. However, they have, for the most part, seemed to stop short of calling for Trump s removal   with the exception of Rep. Maxine Waters, who is, of course, in a league all her own.This level of restraint being exercised by the majority of this powerful group of lawmakers has definitely changed as of late, though. Ever since Trump s disgraceful response to the horrific events in Charlottesville at a rally of neo-Nazis that resulted in countless injuries and the death of a brave young woman, it seems that the Black Caucus is done playing. They want Trump out of office, posthaste. During a conference call held with the press on Monday, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-LA) said of Trump: You can make an argument based on pure competency and fitness to serve, and that s the conversation the caucus will have. Am I concerned about high crimes and misdemeanors? Absolutely. Am I concerned about this president s fitness to serve? Absolutely. Richmond also indicated that Charlottesville was the last straw when it came to giving Trump the benefit of the doubt when it comes to whether or not he really has the concerns of Black America at heart. Granted, all of this is a pipe dream for now. The GOP will criticize Trump until the cows come home, but they sure as hell won t do anything about him. They won t even formally censure him, much less move to remove him from office.All of that could change, however, if the House is returned to Democratic control in 2018. Folks, if we want to save our republic, we ll give the Congressional power to the Democrats next year while we still have a country to save.Featured image via Law Officer",News,"August 21, 2017"
" Body-Slamming Republican Thought He Was Too Important To Be Booked, Printed, Judge Says No Way","You may remember Greg Gianforte, the Republican who won Montana s only Congressional seat in May even after assaulting reporter Ben Jacobs of the Guardian. He disputed the charge at first, then audio came out that clearly depicted him body-slamming the journalist after Jacobs asked a series of uncomfortable questions.Gianforte pled guilty to the charge back in June, although it had no bearing on the outcome of his post-assault election. Presumably, the voters of Montana thought Jacobs had it coming, or perhaps they re so committed to their political party that even an assault charge won t deter them from voting for a GOP candidate.At the time, the Tea Party lawmaker protested the judge s order that he be booked and fingerprinted, as well as have his photo taken for a mug shot. His lawyers argued that the judge didn t have the authority to order the proceedings since he was never actually handcuffed and arrested formally   a feat he pulled off by coincidentally being the candidate the local Sheriff had made political donations to during his campaign.Now, despite his legal team s argument that he was exempt because he was only charged with a misdemeanor, a judge has ordered that Gianforte turn himself in by September 15th for booking on the charge. If the congressman doesn t comply, the judge said, he will be held in contempt of court.Although Gianforte has paid his fines, apologized to Jacobs, and donated $50,000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, he has yet to complete his community service. There is no word whether he has followed through on the anger management classes he was ordered to attend.Practically speaking, a mugshot should worry the congressman when it comes time for reelection. Campaign ads could use it freely, as they are public record. But the question remains whether Gianforte, who raised nearly $120,000 in donations after admitting to the assault, has anything to worry about at all with the voters of Montana.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images",News,"August 21, 2017"

 Donald Trump Never Met A Disaster He Couldn’t Make Much Worse,"Back when conservative politics were actually political, rather than social, there was a guy by the actual real name of Grover Norquist who summed up the aim of Republican politicians:I don t want to abolish government. I simply want to reduce it to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub.Yes, back in the days before Nazis invaded America, Republicans and neo-conservatives focused on just three things. They wanted endless war, tax breaks for the rich, and to dismantle government regulations. Norquist s quote is from 2001, but it sounds a little like he s been skulking around the White House or something because the actual conservatives surrounding Donald Trump appear to be pushing back to that agenda.Oh, and speaking of drowning, that s what happens when you remove safety standards   those mean old nasty gub mint regulations. So why would anyone do that? Well, the short answer is money. It s always money, and fewer regulations mean faster, cheaper work. Normally, a politician can t come out and just say  We re getting rid of safety so rich people can have more money.  But Trump can, because his base is made up of equal parts Nazis, people too busy making Biblical excuses for him to notice, and just plain dumbasses.There wasn t really a chance to test this version of the  shoot someone on 5th Avenue  theory, though. Trump s announcement that he was revoking rules protecting the environment in order to speed up cheap infrastructure was cloaked by his simultaneous defense of the Nazis who murdered Heather Heyer in Charlottesville.The rule change that delivers on the promise of this article s headline is one that used to require federal construction to account for rising sea levels when planning and building a project. That s great for constructing a highway that should take three years in less than one. It s not so great for the people living next to it, or the cities it runs through. The change is to an Obama rule that mandated construction two feet above future flood levels, which means that without that requirement, those fast, cheap roads could be underwater following even a mild natural disaster.FEMA has a few things to say about flooding   that it s the leading cause of death among natural disasters in America, that 85% of all emergency declarations are due to floods, that it costs the government billions to recover from major flooding   but why not take it from me? I know from floods: I live in a town that used to flood every single year. Until our city hunkered down and made some riverfront construction rules, that is. The first year that I moved to this tiny hamlet in the Pacific Northwest, I found myself sandbagging a river with my new neighbors by November. My roommates and I ended up at one of their parents  house 10 miles away, because the water came four feet up the stairs to our apartment.Why did I live in the floodplain? Because I was poor. In fact, people in relative or severe poverty make up the largest percentage of those who live in the path of floods. So it s not only states that will have to pay for flooding damage due to this rule reversal. The hardest-hit by this will be those least able to recover from it.Featured image via Michael B.

 Trump’s Response To USS John S. McCain Collision Was Just Heartless,"It s common knowledge that Donald Trump is a self-obsessed narcissist, but he also considers himself to be somewhat of a patriot, so when the guided-missile destroyer USS John S. McCain was involved in a collision on Sunday evening with an oil tanker near the mouth of the Strait of Malacca en route to Singapore, an incident that left 10 sailors missing and another five injured, one would expect the President of the United States to have some compassionate words.But that wasn t to be the case. Instead, President Trump had a simple three-word reaction for journalists    That s too bad.  The Commander in Chief reportedly didn t even offer any further comment for the media, instead taking to his preferred platform, Twitter, to send his condolences to those involved in the collision, offering the stock-standard  thoughts and prayers  response, but very little else.Thoughts & prayers are w/ our @USNavy sailors aboard the #USSJohnSMcCain where search & rescue efforts are underway. https://t.co/DQU0zTRXNU  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 21, 2017It is unknown whether the President had been briefed prior to commenting on the incident, but regardless, neither his comments to the media or those he later tweeted showed anything that came even remotely close to true compassion.According to the US Navy, the USS John S. McCain, based in Yokosuka, Japan, sustained damage to its port side after colliding with the merchant ship, the accident reported at 5:24 am Monday local time, as the destroyer passed the entrance to one of the world s most congested shipping routes, the Strait of Malacca. Carl Schuster, a former director of operations at the US Pacific Command s Joint Intelligence Center, claims the oil tanker also involved in the incident would have been at least three times larger than the USS John S.

 Secret Service Officially Can’t Afford To Pay Agents Thanks To Trump’s Constant Golf Trips,"Donald Trump has been wasting taxpayer dollars on his personal vacations, protection for his giant golden tower in New York, security at his golf clubs, and pretty much everything else you can imagine ever since he assumed office, but if you needed an example of how bad things are we can t even afford to pay the Secret Service agents protecting him anymore.CNBC reports that more than 1,000 agents have  already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year  thanks to the  crushing workload  Donald Trump has brought them.The Secret Service has a big job with the Trump family. Not only do they have to protect him as he jaunts from golf course to golf course, but they are also forced to protect his sniveling children on their business trips both in the United States and abroad. The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,  Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles said in an interview.  I can t change that. I have no flexibility. The Trump family is such a big problem that Alles says that without more funding, he won t even be able to pay agents for work they have already done:The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump s first term.But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. I don t see this changing in the near term,  Alles said.As the Trump family continues to bleed the country dry with their constant vacations and business trips   all of which require Secret Service protection   Congress is actually considering giving them more money to flush down the toilet as they are forced to pay for hotel rooms, travel, and even $60,000 (and growing) in golf cart rentals.The solution isn t to give the Trump family more money. It s time for Congress to take action to limit travel or pass legislation that would exempt personal vacations and business trips for the President s children from requiring Secret Service protection once the agency s budget has been exhausted.It s time for the Trump family to begin living within the country s means.Featured image via Getty Images/Alex wong",News,"August 21, 2017"
 Bannon Takes His ‘Weapons’ At Breitbart; Smears ‘Quran Kissing’ McMaster In Scathing Hit Piece,"This week s chaotic news cycle was mostly dominated by Donald Trump s disgraceful response to the violence perpetuated by white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and other far-right hate groups in Charlottesville, Virginia. However, that news cycle had a great big exclamation point at the end of it on Friday, when it was announced that Trump s white supremacist Chief Strategist, Stephen K. Bannon would be ousted. Of course, Bannon quickly returned to his perch at Breitbart News, and promised war. Now, we are seeing just what he meant.Everyone remembers the insane interview in which Bannon promised to continue pushing his twisted ideology from outside the White House. He told the Weekly Standard, a conservative publication that has long been critical of Trump, in part: I feel jacked up. Now I m free. I ve got my hands back on my weapons. Someone said,  it s Bannon the Barbarian.  I am definitely going to crush the opposition. There s no doubt. I built a f***ing machine at Breitbart. And now I m about to go back, knowing what I know, and we re about to rev that machine up. And rev it up we will do. Now, aside from the insanity of that remark, it seems that Bannon is just as much of a dangerous lunatic as we all knew him to be. His only loyalties lie with his white supremacist agenda. Therefore, it should come as no surprise that he has already begun attacking Trump s National Security Adviser, H.R. McMaster in the pages of Breitbart. This weekend, the right-wing rag ran a story that featured the following headline: H.R. McMaster Endorsed Book That Advocates Quran-Kissing Apology Ceremonies. The attack charges that McMaster refuses to adequately condemn Islam, which is something of a requirement in pro-Trump circles. Where do they get this evidence? Well, because McMaster allegedly supported a military manual that said not to offend Muslims by desecrating their holy book, the Qu ran. Of course, the radical right only thinks that Christians deserve any respect whatsoever.This is likely just a jumping off point for Breitbart s attacks on McMaster now that Bannon is out of the White House. They will likely go after General Kelly as well. After all, it was known that neither of the Generals was fond of Bannon and the combative and chaotic nature of his White House tenure. Despite the messages coming out of the White House, it is widely believed that General Kelly is the one who actually was able to get Trump to get rid of him.All in all, Bannon s return to Breitbart will likely mean heightened chaos in the White House, and therefore in the nation.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 20, 2017"
 NAACP: Bannon May Be Gone But Trump Is Still A Raging Bigot,"The NAACP issued a statement following the firing of Steve Bannon, Donald Trump s racist chief strategist, on Friday afternoon. The organization explained that while they are certainly glad to see Bannon go, it doesn t change the fact that the sitting president is still a raging bigot. The NAACP is glad to see Steve Bannon out of the White House,  Derrick Johnson, the group s interim president and CEO said in a statement. Ousting one key staffer, however, can t erase the words used by President Trump this week in defense of domestic terrorists, neo-Nazis and white supremacists. President Trump provided permission for these hate groups to exist. Bannon left his job at the right-wing propoganda site, Breitbart News, to sign on as Trump s campaign manager and then became the alleged president s chief strategist following the election. As a well known racist and anti-Semite, Bannon was widely accepted as the bigoted mastermind behind much of Trump s most racist rhetoric and policies.In the statement, the NAACP also called on Trump to fire the rest of  the people who share Steve Bannon s poisonous beliefs, including senior policy adviser Stephen Miller and national security aide Sebastian Gorka.Bannon s firing came after racial tensions in the U.S. reached a fevered pitch following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia that left a counter-protester dead. Trump has repeatedly failed to convincingly denounce these hate groups. Instead, he has chosen to argue that  both sides  were responsible for the violence and accused counter-protesters of violently attacking the poor innocent Nazis, which has lead to widespread outrage.The NAACP is absolutely right. Bannon was just one of many racists in Trump s White House and his departure surely doesn t fix the overall problem, which is that Trump himself holds these same bigoted beliefs.Featured image via Zach Gibson   Pool/Getty Images",News,"August 19, 2017"
" Even After Charlottesville, If You Hit Protesters With A Car, Republicans Want To Protect You","This year America has seen an interesting and terrifying new technique for dealing with protesters. Republicans, buoyed by their base s enthusiasm for physically harming people who inconvenience them, took a hard look at all of the things being protested across the country. They saw natives at Standing Rock, young African-Americans at Black Lives Matter rallies, and a pretty wide assortment at Donald Trump s inauguration, and they decided the best way to deal with it was to hit them with cars.That s not hyperbole. I guarantee you have had at least one argument on Facebook with a relative or old high school friend who sees pictures of protests and jokes about running over the people in the streets. The GOP decided to codify that behavior by writing laws that would reduce or remove penalties for drivers who do just that.Beginning with North Dakota, lawmakers in six states began to pen a series of proposals that all looked very similar to each other. House Bill 1203 would set the tone:Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a driver of a motor vehicle who unintentionally causes injury or death to an individual obstructing vehicular traffic on a public road, street, or highway, is not guilty of an offense.Similar laws cropped up in Florida, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Tennessee, and Texas. These heartless laws were part of a larger effort by Republicans to stifle dissent on a larger scale; a proposal in Oregon would have required schools to expel protesters even peripherally involved in a riot, while one in Ferguson, Missouri   the heartland of the Black Lives Matter movement   would have created an offense called  unlawful traffic interference  with which protesters could be charged if they stood in the path of any important white people on their way to do important white people things.It took until the murder of Heather Heyer for Fox Nation to take down a video posted in humor on their website entitled Here s A Reel Of Cars Plowing Through Protesters Trying To Block The Road. I guess this like what a conscience looks like on Fox?But even after the events of this last weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, those GOP legislators are still defending their bills. On Sunday, Texas Rep. Pat Fallon was wondering if  the far left  knew the difference between a street and a highway. He deleted his social media posts, but his proposal remains:A person operating a motor vehicle who injures another person with the motor vehicle is not liable for the injury if, at the time of the injury:(1) the person operating the motor vehicle was exercising due care; and (2)  the person injured was blocking traffic in a public right-of-way while participating in a protest or demonstration.Any wild guesses what it might take in Texas to prove you were  exercising due care  when you hit that troublesome agitator?Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images",News,"August 18, 2017"
